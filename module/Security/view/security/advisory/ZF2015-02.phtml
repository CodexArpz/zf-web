<h2>ZF2015-02: Potential SQL injection in PostgreSQL Zend\Db adapter</h2>

<p>
    <kbd>Zend\Db</kbd>'s <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
    adapter was incorrectly escaping quotes used for identifiers and values,
    which could lead to potential SQL injection vectors.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    A patch was written that provides the correct PostgreSQL escaping sequence 
    for quotes used for identifiers and values, and tests were added to ensure 
    correctness going forward.
</p>

<p>
    The patch fixing the issue has been applied in the following versions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Zend Framework 2.2.10</kbd>
    <li>Zend Framework 2.3.5</kbd>
</ul>

<p>
    This vulnerability has also been disclosed as <a 
        href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0270">CVE-2015-0270</a>.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

  upgrading immediately.</p>
