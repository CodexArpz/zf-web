<h2>ZF2012-05: Potential XML eXternal Entity injection vectors in Zend Framework 1 Zend_Feed component</h2>

<p>
    <code>Zend_Feed_Rss</code> and <code>Zend_Feed_Atom</code> were found to 
    contain potential XML eXternal Entity (XXE) vectors due to insecure usage of 
    PHP's DOM extension. External entities could be specified by adding a specific
    DOCTYPE element to feeds; exploiting this vulnerability could
    coerce opening arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.
</p>

<p>
    A similar issue was fixed for 1.11.13 and 1.12.0, in the 
    <code>Zend_Feed::import()</code> factory method; however, the reporter of 
    the issue discovered that the individual classes contained similar 
    functionality in their constructors which remained vulnerable.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    A patch was applied that removes the XXE vector by calling
    <code>libxml_disable_entity_loader()</code> before attempting to parse the feed via
    <code>DOMDocument::loadXML()</code>.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are using any of the components listed, and, in particular, were 
    directly instantiating them, we recommend upgrading to either version 
    1.11.15 or 1.12.1 or greater.
