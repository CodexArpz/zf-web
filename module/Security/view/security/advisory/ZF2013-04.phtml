<h2>ZF2013-04: Potential Remote Address Spoofing Vector in Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress</h2>

<p>
    The <code>Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress</code> class provides features
    around detecting the internet protocol (IP) address for an incoming proxied 
    request via the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, taking into account a 
    provided list of trusted proxy server IPs. Prior to 2.2.5, the 
    class was not taking into account whether or not the IP address contained
    in PHP's <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> was in the trusted proxy server
    list.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded-10">IETF draft 
    specification</a> indicates that if <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> is <bold>not</bold>
    a trusted proxy, it <bold>must</bold> be considered the originating IP address, and
    the value of <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> <bold>must</bold> be disregarded.
</p>


<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    We have made the following change to the <code>Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress</code> class:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>If we detect that (a) we will test against proxy servers, and (b) 
        <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> is not in the list of trusted proxy servers,
        we now return the value of <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> immediately, without
        introspecting the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    You are only affected by this as an issue if you directly consume one of the 
    following in your code:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress</code></li>
    <li><code>Zend\Session\Validator\RemoteAddr</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you do, we recommend immediately upgrading to version 2.2.5.
