    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When setting the option 'disableTranslator' to true in any Zend_Form_Element, it isn't being propagated to its validators. At least not to Zend_Validate_NotEmpty (I haven't tested other validators yet).</p>

<p>I don't know if this is done deliberate or not, but I would expect setting 'disableTranslator' to true will cause the entire Zend_Form_Element not to translate anything (including validators and other plugins that are loaded).</p>

<p>I think the source of this problem lies in the way the option 'disableTranslator' is handled by Zend_Form_Element:
By setting it to true, the translator passed to the validators will be 'null' (in stead of an instance of Zend_Translate(_Adapter)).
But when the validator tries to use its translator (which is 'null'), it will load the default translator and things will still be translated.</p>

<p>In my opinion we need to propagate the option 'disableTranslator' itself (not simulate it by passing 'null' as translator as it doesn't completely disable translation).</p>

<p>I've tried to work around this "problem" by setting the option 'autoInsertNotEmptyValidator' to false and manually prepend Zend_Validate_NotEmpty (with 'disableTranslator' in its options) to Zend_Form_Element-s validators.
This way the option 'disableTranslator' will be set on Zend_Validate_NotEmpty itself (and doesn't have to be propagated from Zend_Form_Element).</p>

<p>This also has no effect! (Zend_Validate_NotEmpty will still translate error-messages.)</p>

<p>I've figured out the source of this second "problem": Zend_Validate_NotEmpty doesn't have a constructor:
When the Zend_Form_Element loads its validators, it will instantiate them using the options as constructor-arguments. But because Zend_Validate_NotEmpty doesn't have a constructor, no options will be set.</p>

<p>I've worked around this second "problem" by creating a My_Validate_NotEmpty (which extends Zend_Validate_NotEmpty). I've put a constructor in it which takes 'disableTranslator' as an argument and sets the option.</p>

<p>At first glance this seems like a neat solution, no hacks in existing Zend Framework files were needed and the adjustment I made in My_Validate_NotEmpty is very very small.</p>

<p>But I do think this solution defeats the whole purpose of the option 'disableTranslator' in Zend_Form_Element.</p>

            <p>I've also tested this in the latest stable release: 1.9.7</p>

<p>This "problem" also exists between Zend_Form_Element_Multi and it's 'multiOptions'.</p>
