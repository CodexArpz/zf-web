    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello, I've tried to delete all the entries of a db table, and according to sql commands if the "where" is not setted, all is removed. 
But in Zend, if I do a $dbTable-&gt;delete() it asks for a "where" parameter. But in the parent class, "Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract", this parameter is optional, so I have to use "@$dbTable-&gt;delete()" to do that. I think this parameter should be optional in the other "Zend_Db_Table_Abstract", right?
We are using the trunk version. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I'm not sure about the backwards-compatibility issues around changing Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::delete to empty the table if no parameters are given.  I workaround for this could be:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
// See: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.delete">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>
// See: <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Delete-all-the-rows-of-a-table-tp657469p657472.html">http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…</a>
$table = new Bugs();
$table-&gt;delete('1');
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this is completely portable across all RDBMSes supported by Zend_Db.</p>

            <p>I've attached a patch which implements your suggestion...just in case the CR Team deems your request a valid one for ZFv1.12</p>

            <p>Do we really want to give people the ability to delete their entire table with a single API call?  I'd opt for keeping the current signature as at least, if they really want to delete the whole table, they have to do something like $table-&gt;delete(new Zend_Db_Expr('1 = 1')); (not sure if that actually works).  Reason being, is that if somehow they coded: $table-&gt;delete($someSpec), and spec turns out to be empty, then everything is gone.</p>

<p>I'd have to check the internals, but suggesting that where is optional seems dangerous.</p>

            <p>@Ralph:  Valid point.  The OP was also arguing for consistency, as {{Zend_Db_Adapter::delete}} allows an empty where condition</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
// If $param is empty, delete all rows in the table
$table-&gt;getAdapter()-&gt;delete('table', $param);
</code></pre>

<p>At any rate, it's a trivial issue with a simple workaround, so I don't think it's necessary to pursue it.</p>

            <p>Closing as Won't Fix.  There is a chance that this change could break backwards-compatibility (a logic error resulting in an empty where clause would currently just emit an erorr, but after patch is applied it would empty the table).  As well, an easy-to-use and commonly known workaround exists.</p>
