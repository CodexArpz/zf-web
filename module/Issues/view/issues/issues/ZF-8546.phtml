    <div class="body">
        <p>I hope the title says it all.</p>

<p>It is working well with ZF 1.8.3 but not 1.8.4 and trunk.</p>

            <p>Looking into this, this is purely caused on the programmatic way of doing things and it's down to the changes made for this original issue (ZF-7360) in:</p>

<p>Dojo\View\Helper\ComboBox.php</p>

<p>before you were removing the store parameter passed if it was a programmatic instance,
then using the dijit.byId("dropDown").attr("store", stateStore); to set the store.</p>

<p>This does seem to be caused by the globalised variable because it's being overwritten, the original datastore is no longer accessible via the variable for the first FilteringSelect on a page.
All subsequent datastores for all subsequent FilteringSelects are overwriting the datastore before the filtering selects have ever got a chance to be initialised by Dojo,
hence all filtering selects now only have the last Datastore as their data source.</p>

<p>I'd have to say breaking the options in a drop down is far worse than not being able to set the selected option you want when first loaded.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Temporary fix for this was to assign a unique store value to the store parameter for each of the Filtering Selects.  Before these could be the same, but as the variable is now globalised it must be unique for the store not to be overwritten with subsequent drop-down stores.</p>
