    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Just had a little discussion IRC, questioning whether one should be able to set 
a timezone through the locale resource plugin. Now it can already be done 
through the php settings thingy, so I'm not entirely sure if it's wanted (I personally think it is).</p>

<p>IRC (stripped offtopic stuff):</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
 Freeaqingme|, even if I use locale on older projects,
 I remember still running date_default_timezone_set in my bootstrap
 out of curiosity, how would I set the timezone with locale?
 I thought locale was more related to number
 and currency formatting
 it all is
 I figured that's why we still do date_default_timezone_set
 you just set a region+language
 (assuming you use zend_date)
 yeah, but region doesn't necessarily dictate timezone
 for example, some regions have multiple timezones
 so if I set (for example) en_US - there's no way zend_locale, 
or zend_date could know which timezone I'm running on
....
 You're right
 14.1.1.Â Always Set a Default Timezone
 only in Zend_Date_DateObject
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.html</a>
 Freeaqingme|, cool - thought so... can I safely assume that there
 are no plans to then have Zend_App read in a timezone from the config and 
set it? I should have to do it manually in my own _init* method?
 breakerfall for now it doesn't
 aah wait, I think it's possible
 well, you can use the php settings thingy
 let me test...
 yeah
 date.timezone
 but it should be part of the resource plugin
 I'll put it on my todo to discuss
 you think so?
 breakerfall: but I don't get that error :S
 I never have it
 even if it's covered by phpSettings.date.timezone = "Europe/London" (for example) ?</code></pre>

            <p>Personally, I wouldn't expect the timezone have any relationship with the locale. In the current and previous versions of ZF, they are not linked in any way (that I'm aware of) and the manual still recommends setting the timezone, whether via an environment variable, ini config setting or directly with date_default_timezone_set(). There's no mention of Zend_Locale anywhere in there (or vice versa).</p>

<p>To me, locale dictates how currency, numbers and dates are <em>formatted</em>, along with language... but I would never expect a system to know my timezone if I entered, say, en_US as my locale.</p>

<p>But then wikipedia also states that Locale deals with timezone settings ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale</a> ), so perhaps I'm off-base. I would say though, if you decide that setting the timezone via Zend_App belongs with the locale resource, do you also think that Zend_Locale itself should be concerned with setting the timezone too? It would be confusing/misleading to set the timezone via the locale resource, but not actually have the Zend_Locale classes concern themselves with timezone.</p>

Steven (breakerfall)</p>

            <p>As said on IRC; the reason for adding this issue is because there are several pros and several cons.</p>

<p>If this should be done in Zend_Locale or the resourceplugin I dont know either, just want some people to think about it, so by the end of the day a conclusion can be drawn ;)</p>

            <p>Short note:
Timezones are not related to Locales.
This can lead to massive problems.</p>

<p>Example:
Think of the locale "en"... it is spoken in about 15 different timezones (more than 40 when you take local timezones also in account).</p>

<p>So there is no way to set it automatically.</p>

<p>Even if you have "en_US" you still have the problem that there are 4-5 known timezones (and about 15 local timezones).</p>

<p>This is one of the main reasons why timezones and locales are seperated in 2 independent classes -- Zend_Locale and Zend_Date.</p>

<p>You should also note that setting the default timezone within a script can lead to other problems when running multiple instances.</p>

            <p>I wasn't thinking of doing anything automatically. I was more thinking about an option like resources.locale.timeZone = "America/Los_Angeles"</p>

<p>Which is then parsed in the resource plugin like:
date_default_timezone_set($option['timeZone);</p>
