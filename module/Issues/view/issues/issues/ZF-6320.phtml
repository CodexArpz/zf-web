    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The ViewScript decorator currently uses a view partial to render its view script, this as stated in the performance guide should be avoided. It would be better if there was an option to use render instead, this would also stop bc breaks.</p>

<p>Also in the documentation there is no mention that using large amounts of ViewScript decorated forms would be bad for performance, I think some people may be tempted to use ViewScript if they are having trouble getting to grips with the decorators and over use them, therefore a warning may help matters.</p>
