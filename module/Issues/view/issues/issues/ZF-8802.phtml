    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm not 100% sure that this is a bug, or whether or not I'm using locales inappropriately, however by relying on the en_GB locale and allowing everything to hook into that, such as Zend_Date, ZendX_JQuery, etc. is yielding unexpected results when converting the date format.</p>

<p>The date format for en_GB long and medium is "d MMM y", which when converted from the user input to ISO gets you an unexpected result.</p>

<p>For example - 
User input is "1 Jan 10", which is validated by ZF
When converted to ISO format this yields 0010-01-01.. etc.</p>

<p>Whilst I totally understand why, it would seem more appropriate for the dateformat for long and short to be "d MMM yyyy" by default.</p>

            <p>I'll add that if I'm using locales inappropriately what is the expected way for me to be able to override the various date formats? I'm aware of Zend_Locale_Format::setOptions(), but it doesn't appear to allow me to override the individual formats :)</p>

            <p>The dateformat for long in en_GB is: d MMMM y
Whilst the medium format is d MMM y</p>

<p>These are not equal.
What you are refering to is full which is: EEEE, d MMMM y</p>

<p>Note that you here directly within the internals.
These are provided by unicode and not by Zend and they are worldwide agreed. When there is a problem with those data you should open a issue within unicode itself (<a href="http://unicode.org/cldr">http://unicode.org/cldr</a>)</p>

<p>When you need to format/change/work with dates you should use Zend_Date which allows you to change/define your own format.</p>

<p>Zend_Locale itself does NOT provide date methematics. It is also not able to convert dates to ISO.</p>
