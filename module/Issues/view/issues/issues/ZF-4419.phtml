    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It is stopper for me - I must change Zend folder (add units from snapshot) to work with Firebird in every new release. I am working with it in bigger project and everything in snapshots releases work fine (one small mistake with showing of errors form db like PRIMARY KEY VIOLATION etc. I have written as small Bug issue). There is no reason to block these units in next releases - moreover it has been promised for 1.5 stable release - so I have started to use before the release, thinking I will go for oficial version on March...</p>

            <p>Hi Wil, I'd like to ask few questions:</p>

<h1>There's no ZendX_Db_Adapter_Firebird in 1.7.0. It's in 1.7.1. Shouln't this be added in minor release instead of mini releas?</h1>

<h1>There's no documentation for this adapter nor in Reference Guide neither in API Guide. Just a shor paragraph (13.1.10.10) in Reference Guide, but not even mentioning that the adapter is in extras. How can be such an undocumented adapter contained in release?</h1>

<h1>Why isn't this adapter mentioned in changelog?!</h1>
