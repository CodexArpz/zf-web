As part of our continued effort to ensure that Product Advertising API is an efficient and effective advertising tool, we've identified opportunities to streamline the API. Certain operations and response groups currently supported are infrequently used or are not aligned with the primary purpose of the Product Advertising API, which is to enable Associates to make money by advertising Amazon products in their websites and applications and sending traffic back to Amazon.</p>

<p>The changes, described below, will help us continue to provide you with relevant and useful features to advertise Amazon products. The following changes to the API will take effect on November 1, 2011: 
Associate Tag will be a required and verified input parameter in all requests to the API
SellerLookup, SellerListingLookup and SellerListingSearch operations will no longer be supported by the API
ItemPage parameter will be limited to a maximum of 10 pages for ItemSearch results
MerchantId parameter will no longer be supported for filtering offers, variations and search results
Merchants search index will no longer be supported
Data returned by the Offers and ItemAttributes response groups will be limited to the most frequently used attributes
The new Product Advertising API interface definition (WSDL) is now available. While your application may continue to operate after November 1, 2011 using older WSDLs, we will stop supporting all previous versions on February 21, 2012. Please upgrade to the latest WSDL before that date to ensure the continued operation of your application.</p>

            <p>Is there a chance, this will make it into the offical branch or do I need to patch ZF by myself?</p>

            <p>Norbert - can you provide a patch that also updates the test suite? If so, I'll apply, and we'll include in our next release (not sure if that will be a 1.11 release or 1.12.0 at this time).</p>

            <p>As far as I see, the functionality used by ZF has not changed and the existing tests pass.</p>

            <p>In at least the offline tests, the URL used is part of the assertions; as such, the tests need to be updated to ensure these pass.</p>

            <p>Matthew:  I checked the Zend_Service_Amazon test suite, and the only place I found mention of the URLs identified in the patch were in the XML files.  I've corrected them in the attached patch.</p>

            <p>Fixed in trunk (1.12.0): r24780 r24782</p>

<p>Could someone with access to the Product Advertising API please run the online tests against trunk to ensure they still work as expected?</p>
