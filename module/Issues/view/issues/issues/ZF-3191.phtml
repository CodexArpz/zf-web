    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This may impact on users of other databases that support domains, but I can only be sure about the RDBMS I'm using - PostgreSQL. In situations where a column data type has been set to a domain type, describeTable returns the name of that domain in the DATA_TYPE entry, but the actual base type of the domain is unavailable.</p>

<p>Perhaps an additional entry (say BASE_DATA_TYPE) for each column could be added to the $desc array returned by describeTable() denoting the actual data type?  For columns that don't use domains, or databases that don't support domains, this could be equal to DATA_TYPE.</p>

<p>I would be happy to produce a patch myself, but I am new to ZF.  If someone could provide some pointers as to the places I'd need to look other than the Database Adapters, I'll give it a go.</p>

<p>I have searched the issue tracker and can not find any duplicates of this. Apologies if one exists and escaped my attention.</p>

            <p>I'm assigning this to Ralph, but the reporter may have to communicate with him about the issue, as we may not have the PostGRES expertise required to understand/implement this on the Zend team.</p>
