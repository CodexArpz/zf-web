    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I want to use ZendAmf for sending Arrays from a .swf to php. The arrays contain integers (which can be positive and negative). If the integer is negative, php receives a number which apparently is 4294967295 minus the negative value.
AmfPhp had the same problem, thats why i wanted to switch to ZendAmf.</p>

            <p>I just tried it again with the array:
[-10, 10, -1000, 1000];
Php receives:
4294967286,10,4294966296,1000
I think this just happens online, locally it works (i am not sure at the moment).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I can confirm this issue. It happens to all integers, if php is running on a 64 bit system. (The sign bit was extended with the assumption that an int has 32 bits)</p>

<p>I attached a patch to fix this.</p>

<p>Regards Stefan</p>

            <p>Hi,
with the patch ist works correctly! 
As i am very new to this stuff, just to make sure that i understood how the patch was meant:
I changed the line beginning with -
to the line beginning with +
It seems to be correct.
Thank you very much!
Patrick</p>

            <p>Yes thats how a patch works. Have a look at the command line tools 'patch' and 'diff'. 'man patch' will give you more infos.</p>

<p>Cheers Stefan</p>
