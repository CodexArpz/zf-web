    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>1 -  getValue method return the destination directory when there is no file submitted. It should return false or null, The bug in the Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http class. (This still exist in the trunk version. Also i believe its the adapter problem)
2 - The validation not working as expected. (The validation working in the trunk version as expected)
3 - The  class should contains receive method  warp the  $this-&gt;getTransferAdapter()-&gt;receive() call
4 - The Filter component don't have a MD5 or SHA filter and its very important filter for the file uploading mechanism. 
The receive method copy the file to a destination directory with the uploaded file name which  in most cases not safe, I mean file name filtering. Zend_Form_Element_File itself hold a NAME and adapter. We should be able to filter the file name for example md5(time())</p>

<p>Sorry, I edit the bug because i can't find the comment link :(</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Filters are delayed until 1.7... actually there are no filters available.</p>

<p>Please give example code describing your problems.
What have you meant with "validation not working as expected" ?</p>

<p>You have throwed 2 components and 4 issues in one. Please devide this next time, as it's easier for us. There are different authors for these components.</p>

<p>Please give us the release you have expect the problems with.
Have you tried the actual trunk release ?</p>

            <p>What should a MD5/SHA1 filter do ?
Filters are build in to change the content of a file.</p>

<p>MD5 is supposed only to verify if a file has a MD5 hash or not.
Did you mean a MD5 validator ?</p>

            <p>Issue contains multiple duplications and no new issues... therefor it will be closed in favor of the other issues.</p>

<p>Regarding to the several points:</p>

<p><em>1</em>
getValue of Zend_File_Transfer will always return the set directory and file. It will never return null when there is something set. This is not a problem.</p>

<p><em>2</em>
When validation works in trunk, it's already fixed</p>

<p><em>3</em>
This is a duplication of ZF-4062</p>

<p><em>4</em>
This is a duplication of ZF-4123. Beware MD5 hashes are generally done for file content and not for file names.</p>
