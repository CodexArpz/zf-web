    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I got some errors starting with Cannot redeclare class
I started to get rid of them one by one using if (class_exists) cases, so I'm not sure which one was first but it was likely Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Abstract.</p>

<p>After a lot of headache, I figured the problem might be, that zf.bat (@ G:\www\zf\zf1.9.7\bin) started to work on G:\www\zf\zf1.9.7\library and than it started using the G:\www\myproject\library folder after the script found my project. To make it worse I didn't copy the library folder into my project folder but used junction for emulating symlinks.</p>

<p>The problem described above might not be exact or completely even wrong, but if you find yourself in a situation like this, here's my solution:
- I removed the library folder from my include path completely, and put zf.bat and zf.php into my project folder. I should have moved it into my application folder to make it magicly work, but I felt that to be a bit dirty, so I changed zf.php on line #158 to 
bq. $zfIncludePath['relativePath'] = dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>) . '/library/';
I suppose this should always work.</p>
