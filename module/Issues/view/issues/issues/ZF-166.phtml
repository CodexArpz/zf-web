    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>h3. Overview:
I gave the Zend_Controller_Router_Route (Route.php) class of the RewriteRouter some new features for defining routes and capturing parameters.  It can now match anything the Ruby on Rails router is capable of matching while maintaining 100% backwards compatibility with the current RewriteRouter.</p>

<p>h3. Benefits over the current Zend_Controller_Router_Route:
* less overhead when defining a route.  In my AdvancedRoute class __construct()'s only job is to store 3 variables into the object.  No looping or processing occurs until match() or assemble() is called.  In the current Zend_Controller_Router_Route class each call to __construct() performs 2 cases of typecasting, an explode, foreach loop containing 2 if statements, and 2 calls to substr().  Let's say you have a large site with 100 routes and the 90th route you defined is a match.  Using AdvancedRoute you will only parse and process 10 routes but with Zend_Controller_Router_Route you parse all 100 routes every request whether or not you used them in addition to processing 10 routes.
* {{:variables}} can be defined anywhere and in any combination in your route, not just in between {{/}}'s
* {{:variables}} can be next to eachother
* wildcards can be defined anywhere in your route and you can use more than one wildcard as opposed to Zend_Controller_Router_Route which only allows a single wildcard at the end of the route with a hardcoded var1/value1/var2/value2 format.
* All of this comes at a cost of only {{.1}} (yes that is point one) millisecond per request.  AdvancedRoute is 100% backwards compatible with the existing Zend_Controller_Router_Route so no code has to be changed.</p>

<p>h3. How To Install (updated to reflect RewriteRouter API change in SVN):</p>

<h1>Create a folder {{Custom/Controller/Router}} inside your Zend Framework {{"library"}} folder.  If you created the folders in the correct place you should see both {{"Zend"}} and {{"Custom"}} next to eachother in the {{"library"}} folder</h1>

<h1>Download the topmost {{AdvancedRoute.php}} from the attached files above and place it in your {{Custom/Controller/Router}} folder</h1>

<p>h3. How To Use:</p>

<pre class="literal">
&lt;?php
$router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();

// you can add routes like normal still
$router-&gt;addRoute('news', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('news/:controller/:action/:id'));

// AdvancedRoute routes are backwards compatible so the same code works
$router-&gt;addRoute('news', new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute('news/:controller/:action/:id'));

// but now you can also add routes which require advanced matching
$router-&gt;addRoute(
    'logViewer',
    new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute(
        ':controller/:action/customer{:id}httpd-error.:ext',
        array(),
        array('id' =&gt; '\d+')
    )
);
</pre>

<p>NOTE: When naming {{:variables}} in your Advanced Routes use the PHP variable naming conventions.  Basicly the name can only consist of the following characters: {{_, A-Z, 0-9, and ASCII characters from 127 through 255}}.
For more information please look at <a href="http://php.net/variables">http://php.net/variables</a></p>

<p>h3. Examples:
In Zend_Controller_Router_Route, routes are limited to only one variable between each {{'/'}} in the url.  Now you can define routes with variables anywhere such as:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$router-&gt;addRoute(
    'logViewer',
    new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute(
        ':controller/:action/file:id.:ext',
        array(),
        array('id' =&gt; '\d+')
    )
);
matches: <a href="http://mysite.com/log/view/file206.xml">http://mysite.com/log/view/file206.xml</a>
Array
(
    [controller] =&gt; log
    [action] =&gt; view
    [id] =&gt; 206
    [ext] =&gt; xml
)
</pre>

<p>If a variable in the route is ambiguous, you can escape it with {}'s:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$router-&gt;addRoute(
    'logViewer',
    new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute(
        ':controller/:action/customer{:id}httpd-error.:ext',
        array(),
        array('id' =&gt; '\d+')
    )
);
matches: <a href="http://mysite.com/log/view/customer206httpd-error.log">http://mysite.com/log/view/â€¦</a>
Array
(
    [controller] =&gt; log
    [action] =&gt; view
    [id] =&gt; 206
    [ext] =&gt; log
)
</pre>

<p>You can also use (multiple) wildcards to capture parameters:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$router-&gt;addRoute(
    'directions',
    new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute(
        'search/:action/from/:from/to/:to',
        array('controller' =&gt; 'mapit'),
        array('from' =&gt; '.+', 'to' =&gt; '.+')
    )
);
matches: <a href="http://mysite.com/search/getDirections/from/1866">http://mysite.com/search/getDirections/from/1866</a> Euclid Ave/Cleveland/OH/44315/to/Rome/Italy
Array
(
    [controller] =&gt; mapit
    [action] =&gt; getDirections
    [from] =&gt; 1866%20Euclid%20Ave/Cleveland/OH/44315
    [to] =&gt; Rome/Italy
)
</pre>

<p>You can even put two variables next to eachother:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$router-&gt;addRoute(
    'onlineStore',
    new Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute(
        ':controller/:action/:model_id:modelnum',
        array(),
        array('model_id' =&gt; '[a-z]+', 'modelnum' =&gt; '\d+')
    )
);
matches: <a href="http://mysite.com/product/info/MX1035347">http://mysite.com/product/info/MX1035347</a>
Array
(
    [controller] =&gt; product
    [action] =&gt; info
    [model_id] =&gt; MX
    [modelnum] =&gt; 1035347
)
</pre>

<p>h3. Benchmarks:
What do these changes cost in speed?  The quick answer is that AdvancedRoute tested 2.78 requests per second less than Zend_Controller_Router_Route or about {{.1}} millisecond slower per request.  The test machine is a 2.4GHz Celeron and 1GB RAM running FreeBSD 6.1 with PHP 5.14 no optimizer (such as APC, Zend Optimizer, Turck) running as a fastcgi on Apache 2.2.2.  I ran each script 10 times after a freshly restarted apache and the 2nd best result was picked for each script.  Here are the results:</p>

            <p>Fixed some regex bugs.  Now passes all of the Route tests except for "testVariablesWithDefaultAndRequirementAndIncorrectValue".  I'm not sure if this test is correct or not.  In my opinion returning false is correct in this case.</p>

            <p>Okay I just installed Ruby on Rails and tested the behavior I commented above (testVariablesWithDefaultAndRequirementAndIncorrectValue).</p>

<p>On line 156 of RouteTest.php it has:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(':<a>controller:/:action:/:year</a>:', array('year' =&gt; 2006), array('year' =&gt; '\d+'));
</pre>

<p>It was my opinion that if {{:year:}} did not match the {{\d+}} regex then the path does not match this route and {{match()}} should return {{false}}.  After testing on RoR they also have the same behavior.  In the current RouteTest.php it is expecting {{:year:}} to drop back to the default {{2006}} if it did not match the {{\d+}} regex.  What are your opinions on this?  Should it return {{false}} or drop {{:year:}} to the default {{2006}} and consider it a match?</p>

var_dump($values);
</code></pre>

<p>RouteM is your route of course. I will test it again when I will have a working solution.</p>

<p>About a benchmark. You have to test it with Apache Benchmark since php has a per-thread global pool of compiled regexes. In your solution you set a different regex for each route so they have to be compiled every time - now imagine a big site with 100-1000 routes. My solution has only one regex regardles of the number of routes so it theoretically it should run faster. I will benchmark both when you provide working code.</p>

            <p>Christopher Thompson proposed a different aproach for a wildcard match which suites me better. It involves two step matching - at routes level and a controller or an action level. You will be able to define global application routes (like now but with a wildcard probably) and local routes where you will be able to define routes for that particular controller only. This may save a lot of matching at global level.</p>

<p>Now about many variables per "dir". I have it on my to do list and I'll try to implement it in the future. But it's really low priority for now.</p>

            <p>Well, I forgot you have changed the variable representation. For above route the benchmark is:</p>

<p>Not matching routes - common. Remeber you will have to check this O(n) times:</p>

<p>Match - your:
Requests per second:    287.93 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       34.731 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       3.473 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)</p>

<p>Both are faster in my code but the difference is negligible.</p>

            <p>Ahh so much for that I guess... I thought I had a breakthrough in routing :)  I think it would be good to test this regex method vs your current looping method when you implement "multiple vars per dir" and "wildcard vars".  Benchmarking routing code isn't easy because the input varies so much and a certain path/map might be faster w/ loops and slower w/ regex or vice versa.  I must say this is a great challenge to figure out a solution to this problem though!</p>

            <p>I am reopening this issue on the following basis:</p>

<ul><li>My changes to the router are now 100% backwards compatible and current with the most recent changes in SVN</li>
<li>There is only a 3-5 request per second speed decrease in exchange for the ability to match routes with the same flexibility as Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>There are similar or less lines of code in this router than the current Route.php</li>
<li>The code is now easier to understand in this version compared to previous versions.</li>
</ul><p>My proposal is for Custom_Controller_Router_AdvancedRoute (AdvancedRoute.php) to be renamed to Zend_Controller_Router_Route (Route.php) and replace the current Route.php used for the RewriteRouter.  The performance difference is neglegible and the features / flexibility gained are more than worth it.</p>

            <p>Route is not backwards compatible (failed unt tests) and it's flexibility is just not worth the effort.</p>

<p>Michael, I'm not going to accept a total rewrite of the class which does exactly the same thing but in another manner. Accept that. It won't make it, so don't waste your energy on something that's already functional. Focus on something that's not ready yet - there are a lot of fields where your help will count.</p>

            <p>It most definitely is 100% backwards compatible.  The problem is that your unit tests are flawed.</p>

<p>__construct() expects a string and 2 optional arrays</p>

<p>{{testVariablesWithRequirementAndValue()}} and {{testVariablesWithRequirementAndIncorrectValue()}} supply a null value for a parameter which is expected to be an array.  Your code allows for the error while mine simple enforces it and provides a detailed error message.</p>

<p>and no the current router does not do exactly the same thing.  Please explain how to do any one of the above examples using the current Route.php.  I wrote this code because the current Route.php was not functional enough.  You have to remember that both beginners and expert developers will be using this framework.  Your Route.php has the beginner developers covered but when you want to get into more advanced matching it falls short.  People have been asking for this functionality on the mailing list.  Issues have been opened in the tracker for situations where the current router did not meet their needs.  People are using AdvancedRoute.php right now because they need more than what is offered by Route.php.  Those who are coming from other frameworks expect at least the level of routing functionality that their old frameworks had, not less.  It should not be this hard to give away code that works.</p>
