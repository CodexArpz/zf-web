    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Locale: I need to get translationData in specified encoding e.g. WIN1251 (one-byte Cyrillic encoding) instead UTF-8.</p>

<p>Now I have to override getTranslationData method and realize converted via iconv function, but I think It is not a right way in general.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The complete I18N core is designed for UTF-8.
Also all informations like the locale data repository is only avaiable in UTF-8.</p>

<p>We can not only add specific encoding for one function or class, it would have been done for the complete I18N core. And this is no shortterm decision. There are much pro's and con's which have to be cleared before.</p>

<p>So we will postpone this issue for now... has to be reviewed in detail.</p>

<p>But for your problem:
The proper way would not be to "override" the function, but to add an view-helper which does the conversion for you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind... the complete I18N classes are not designed to generate visible output... they are helpers which can be polished to solve specific problems. Visibility is part of Zend_View/_Layout and co.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>All data is in UTF-8.
Also if encoding could be set, it would incoperate new problems because data would not be visible through UTF-8 symbols not avaiable in most encodings.</p>

<p>Integrating this into the core would also make all classes which make use of Zend_Locale dependend from iconv or mbstring which is actually not the case.</p>

<p>On the other side, everyone who want's to output localized informations from ZF could easily create a simple helper or even hardcode it to convert UTF-8 to customizes encodings.</p>

<p>The problems arising of the integration are too big against the additional feature.
This issue will therefor be closed as "won't fix".</p>
