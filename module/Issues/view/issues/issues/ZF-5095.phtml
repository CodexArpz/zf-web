    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Maybe it would be more convenient if Zend_Log didn't throw exception (No writers were added) when trying to log and there were no writers set.
I kinda don't want to add Null writers just to make all my log calls quiet.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better  (and faster) if that sanity check inside Zend_Log::log() was removed and just return if there are no writers?</p>

            <p>I think there are 2 sides to the argument. Those who are assuming that they have writers added will be confused if they weren't actually added, and the exception thrown would help such users. Those who intentionally do not add writers can make this clear in a self-documenting way by adding a null writer. In any case, this is a design change that would not be considered for a minor release.</p>
