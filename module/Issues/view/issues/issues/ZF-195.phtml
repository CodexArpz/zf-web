    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The ability to specify the Return-path is quite useful, especially when wanting to direct bounces to a different address from the Sender address. From my research and testing the MAIL FROM command in SMTP allows the Return-path to be specifed.</p>

<p>It would be great if there was a way to specify the email address used by the following method in Mail/Transport/Smtp.php.</p>

<pre><code>public function mail_from($from_email)
{
    $this-&gt;_send('MAIL FROM: &lt;'.$from_email.'&gt;');
    $this-&gt;_expect(250);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hardcoded the $from_email and got the behaviour I was looking for.  We really need to have a method that allows this to be set on the fly as individual emails are being sent - maybe something like $mail-&gt;setReturnPath()...</p>

            <p>Not a blocker, as the mail component can be used without this feature. However, it would be nice to have, and has been slated for the 0.2.0 release.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>It should be noted in the final documentation that using an email address in SMTP's MAIL FROM that differs from the mail header "From:" will increase the likelihood that anti-spam systems will file that email into the "junk/spam" folder.</p>

<p>Note that the mail header's "From:" can use any name in combination with an email address identical to whatever is desired for MAIL FROM.  For example,</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
From:  "My Name" </code></pre>

<p>Thus, setting a different email address in MAIL FROM than in the "From:" mail header is not considered "best practice", and generally should be discouraged.  The "Reply-To:" header solves the issue of someone replying to the bounce address, when the bounce address is using for the "From:" and "MAIL FROM".</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Reply-To is a non-standard mail header; Return-Path <em>is</em> standard and addressed in RFC-2821 as the appropriate place to set an alternate address for bouncebacks.</p>

<p>I've updated Zend_Mail and Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp to in commit 927 in SVN to address this; tests were also written and pass.</p>
