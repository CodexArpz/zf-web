    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am working with zend studio. I am using zend firefox toolbar for debug.
Everything worked fine until today. At a certain debugging session I was asked unexpectedly to select local debugging resource.
After selecting local debugging resource and setting a breakpoint on a function I started getting the following faulr response from the server:</p>

<p>Class "servicesEP" does not exist: Plugin by name 'ServicesEP' was not found in the registry; used paths:</p>

<p>Please note that if I do not set breakpoint the application works correctly and I do not get any error messages.</p>

<p>My first question is? Why this error message
My second question is: is there a way to change the setting to local resouce zend debugger is now pointing?
I tried to reset the project, restart zend studio and restart the machine but no way.</p>

<p>This is the second time I report a bug regarding this error:
The first time Igot this error deploying an application to a server, but unfortunately the problem was not solved.</p>

            <p>Hi, paolo anghileri.</p>

<p>I recommend You to ask Zend Technology how to fix.
This issue is not Zend Framework issue, I think.</p>
