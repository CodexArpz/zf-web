    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I was working on a ZF application based on ZF 1.10.0. Then env is: WinXP, Apache 2.2.11, PHP 5.3.1, MySQL.</p>

<p>I made one very small change: replaced the 1.10.0 with 1.10.1 (or 1.10.2 the same effect) and no any other change and all over the application are errors because some resources doesn't seems to be auto-loaded properly.</p>

<p>Here is my include_path:</p>

<pre><code>set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
    ZF_LIBRARY_PATH,
    BASE_PATH . '/library',
    get_include_path()
)));
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to switch all the application resources to use absolute path but errors again....</p>

<p>Sample for Application Resources...</p>

<p>As i repeat: there is no other application or WAMP environment change than changing the ZF version from 1.10.0 to .1/.2</p>

            <p>It's clear you're using open_basedir, which places filesystem access restrictions. Prior to 1.10.1, we were using a hack that utilized some functionality in fopen() -- basically, fopen() allows a flag that will allow it to search for the file specified on the include_path. Unfortunately, due to the way it worked, we had to use the error suppression operator to eliminate notices, it would not work with stream wrappers, and it circumvented the open_basedir settings. We've moved to a solution that iterates over the include_path and calls is_readable() instead, which solves all three issues.</p>

<p>The obvious downside, of course, is if you had an open_basedir setting, and had files that lived outside that path. This was something we had not anticipated with the change, and which we didn't discover until after the release.</p>

<p>The solution is to ensure that all files used by your application live within the tree specified by open_basedir. This may require copying trees (versus symlinking them) into your project directory. Better yet, don't use open_basedir, as it's a setting that's easily circumvented (as our fopen() hack proved) and which provides very limited security benefits.</p>

            <p>I also noticed some related weird behavior as:</p>

<p>Warning: is_readable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(D:\wamp\frameworks\ZendFramework-1.10.2/D:_Work\myapp/application/modules\articles/views\helpers/HeadLink.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (D:_Work\;D:\wamp\;C:\Windows\Temp\;c:\php5\pear) in D:\wamp\frameworks\ZendFramework-1.10.2\Zend\Loader.php on line 190</p>

<p>So basically looking for the helpers is failing, as are checked the Zend_View_Helper into modules helpers paths, not into Zend/View/Helper.</p>

<p>This is NOT a open_basedir problem actually...</p>

            <p>So there is problem: all files reside under open_basedir paths but won't load. So that upgrade made on 1.10.1 is fine as long has a patch to solve the below problems (which probably is not impossible)...</p>

            <p>I found a way to solve the problem. May not be the optimal way, but:</p>

<pre><code>public static function isReadable($filename)
{
    if (is_readable($filename)) {
        // Return early if the filename is readable without needing the 
        // include_path
        return true;
    }

            //added the if, basically to skip any absolute filename path
    if(!is_readable(dirname($filename)))
        foreach (self::explodeIncludePath() as $path) {
            if ($path == '.') {
                if (is_readable($filename)) {
                    return true;
                }
                continue;
            }
            $file = $path . '/' . $filename;
            if (is_readable($file)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

    return false;
}

<p>This would solve the problem of this raising a Warning.</p>

            <p>It would be nice if this issue could be fixed for those where open_basedir is force upon. It's a rather dirty solution to distribute the full ZF library with every app, so a shared directory would be preferred.</p>

            <p>As stated into last comment the problem itself has nothing to do directly with shared directory. The open_basedir warning is raised due to wrong isReadable implementation (and not due to using shared directory).</p>

<p>Anyway, using a shared directory with ZF would be possible again once this bug is fixed.</p>

<p>For now we are stuck at 1.10.0...</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I can't use 1.10.0 either because of a bug in XCache. Which is resolved I believe in a recent update of XCache but Ubuntu 8.04 doesn't include that version.</p>

            <p>@Christiaan Kras: The bug you're alluding to is fixed in 1.10.1 and up -- it had to do with Zend_Exception's definition, and we were able to find a solution that would work both with older versions of XCache as well as more recent versions.</p>

            <p>@Christiaan: I was simply responding to your previous comment, which noted issues with XCache; the way the comment was worded, it was not clear if you were also experiencing the issue reported here.</p>

<p>@Christian: I'm quite aware it's not fixed in 1.10.3. As noted on the mailing list, I need a reproduce case. Current versions work fine in Windows, Linux, and Mac using a stock PHP; I need to know if the only variable here is open_basedir, or if there are additional factors.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I think it is exclusively a Windows issue due to the fact that Windows uses drive letters and *nix does not. If you concatenate two Linux absolute paths, the result is still a valid path even if it does not point to an actual file. If you concatenate a Windows absolute path to the end of any other path (relative OR absolute), the result IS NOT a valid path.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="literal">
include_path = /home/www/site/zendframework/library

openbase_dir = /home/www/site

$loader-&gt;isReadable('/home/www/site/application/controllers/helpers/Redirector.php');
</pre>

<p>Inside the isReadable method, it would eventually test this path:</p>

<pre class="literal">

Even though the path does not point to a valid file, the path itself is still valid and it meets the condition specified in openbase_dir.

On Windows, however it looks like this:

</pre>

<p>include_path = C:\www\site\zendframework\library</p>

<p>openbase_dir = C:\www\site</p>

<p>$loader-&gt;isReadable('C:\www\site\application\controllers\helpers\Redirector.php');</p>

<pre class="literal">

Inside the isReadable method, it would eventually test this path:

</pre>

<p>The drive letter specification inside the path is not valid, and PHP issues the warning.</p>

<p>I think the solution to this problem would be check for a drive letter at the beginning of the path to be tested if the OS is Windows, and if a drive letter is found it is clearly an absolute path that cannot be appended to any of the paths found in include_path. I'm not sure if the PHP_OS test below is totally correct, but I think the solution is to change Zend_Loader::isReadable() to look like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    public static function isReadable($filename)
    {
        if (is_readable($filename)) {
            // Return early if the filename is readable without needing the 
            // include_path
            return true;
        }

        if (PHP_OS == 'WINNT' &amp;&amp; preg_match('/^[A-Z]:/i', $file)) {
            // This is an absolute path for a Windows system. We already tried
            // is_readable on the path and it failed, so return false
            return false;
        }
        
        foreach (self::explodeIncludePath() as $path) {
            if ($path == '.') {
                if (is_readable($filename)) {
                    return true;
                }
                continue;
            }

            <p>Andrew -- thanks for the analysis! I noticed the same issue about the full path being added in, and that clearly represents an issue. I was initially worried about the usage of PCRE, but realized that it would only kick in on Windows, and only if the initial test failed. The performance hit should hopefully be fairly minimal, and restricted to Windows environments.</p>

<p>I've added a test and patched the code in trunk and the 1.10 release branch; the fix should be released in 1.10.4.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry but this bug still isn't resolved on Linux (Ubuntu 8.04, suhosin patch, safe_mode on and open_basedir in effect).</p>

<p>I followed your suggestion in ZF-9166 made sure all paths were absolute. Which then led to an issue of not being able to include a file that was symlinked. So instead of symlinking I copied it to the same directory, made sure permissions were correct and included the file. Right after that all the include errors popped up again.</p>

<p>Below is on of the messages I'm getting, amongst many other failed attempts to load other plugins.</p>

<p>Here's how I've set my include path:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
set_include_path(
    PATH_SEPARATOR . '/usr/local/share/ZendFramework/1.10.4/library/' . 
    PATH_SEPARATOR . $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/modules/default/models/' .
    PATH_SEPARATOR . $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/modules/software/models/' .

    PATH_SEPARATOR . $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/include/' .
    PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path()
);
</code></pre>

<p>By default my include_path contains {{:/usr/share/<a>php:/usr/share/pear</a>}}. After modifieng it it contains {{:/usr/local/share/ZendFramework/1.10.4/library/:/var/www/www_domain_com/app/current/www/lib/modules/default/models/:/var/www/www_domain_com/app/current/www/lib/modules/software/models/:/var/www/www_domain_com/app/current/www/lib/modules/bijlage/models/:/var/www/www_domain_com/app/current/www/lib/include/:.:/usr/share/<a>php:/usr/share/pear</a>}}.</p>

<p>My {{$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']}} points to {{/var/www/www_domain_com/app/current/www}}. All paths are correct, as well as any file permissions.</p>

<p>My Apache configuration:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

<p>I think your issue is slightly different. None of the paths in any of the warning messages you posted above are within your open_basedir restriction. The open_basedir restriction is doing what it was designed to do. If the warning were happening on line 176 (version 1.10.4) I could see an issue, but since it is happening on line 198 it means that your include paths are referring to paths that are not valid based on the open_basedir configured for your site.</p>

<p>One of your default include paths is {{/usr/share/pear}}, but that is not in your {{open_basedir}} restriction. Adding {{/usr/share/pear}} to your open_basedir should eliminate three (nearly half) of the warnings you listed.</p>

<p>Also, your {{include_path}} begins with a path separator, which means that when ZF tries resolving relative paths using your include_path setup, it will turn them into absolute paths.</p>

<p>For example, when attempting to locate {{Zend_View_Helper_HeadTitle}}, the {{Zend_Loader}} instance will call {{$this-&gt;isReadable('Zend/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php')}}. When it does, the first iteration of the loop inside the method will look like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
190:        foreach (self::explodeIncludePath() as $path) { // $path = '', $filename = 'Zend/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php'
191:            if ($path == '.') {                         // false; skip this block; go to line 197
192:                if (is_readable($filename)) {
193:                    return true;
194:                }
195:                continue;
196:            }
197:            $file = $path . '/' . $filename;            // $file = '' . '/' . 'Zend/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php';
198:            if (is_readable($file)) {                   // is_readable('/Zend/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php') ---&gt; WARNING!!!!
199:                return true;
200:            }
201:        }
</code></pre>

<p>{panel:title=Warning|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#F7D6C1|bgColor=#FFFFCE}Warning: is_readable() [function.is-readable]: open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/Zend/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/www_domain_com/www:/tmp:/usr/local/share/ZendFramework:/usr/share/php) in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework/1.10.4/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 198{panel}</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the three remaining paths it is testing:</p>

<pre class="literal">
/lib/include/KD/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php
/lib/modules/default/views/helpers/Helper/HeadTitle.php
/lib/include/DP/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php
</pre>

<p>However, I suspect these are also warnings that result from trying to locate relative paths ( {{KD/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php}}, {{default/views/helpers/Helper/HeadTitle.php}}, and {{DP/View/Helper/HeadTitle.php}} ) that get converted to absolute paths as demonstrated above.</p>

<p>I think if you do three things:</p>

<p>1) Set your default include path to {{/usr/share/<a>php:/usr/share/pear</a>}} instead of {{:/usr/share/<a>php:/usr/share/pear</a>}}
2) Set {{php_admin_value open_basedir "/var/www/www_domain_com/www:/tmp:/usr/local/share/ZendFramework:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear"}} in your VirtualHost config
3) Change this block so that your include_path does not begin with an empty path:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
set_include_path(
    '/usr/local/share/ZendFramework/1.10.4/library/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . 
    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/modules/default/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . 
    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/modules/software/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . 
    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/modules/bijlage/models/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . 
    $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/lib/include/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . 
    get_include_path()  // this works as long as your default include_path is not empty
);
</code></pre>

<p>most (if not all?) of these warnings will go away.</p>

<p>Or you could (as Matthew originally suggested, and Christian most recently mentioned) simply remove the open_basedir requirement.</p>

            <p>I have found another issue to this problem (it seems to be the same but shorter).</p>

<p>Just replace ZF default paths configuration in your index.php file by :</p>

<p>set_include_path(
    APPLICATION_PATH.'/../library'.PATH_SEPARATOR.
    APPLICATION_PATH.'/../library/Zend'
);</p>

<p>Now the path to application/Zend/Views/Helpers... is readable!</p>

            <p>@dvdgssm The default include path generated by Zend_Tool (zf) should be sufficient.  Adding library/Zend to the include path doesn't make sense.  Anyway, please open a new ticket instead of commenting in a resolved ticket if you think this is a bug that needs to be fixed. Thanks</p>
