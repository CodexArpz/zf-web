    <div class="body">
        <p>Quickstart guide should mention custom routes, or at least a bit about zend_application resource plugins.</p>

            <p>You can add routes anywhere before routing. However, since you're using zend_app, obviously you can just use the Router Resource Plugin: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.available-resources.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a> rendering an _initRouter() method useless.</p>

            <p>That's fine, but there needs to be a blurb in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a> that discusses what you've just said.</p>

<p>Is initRouter deprecated? If so there should be some documentation about this.</p>

<p>This should be open until the documentation linked above is updated.</p>

<p>Why does it need to be there? As said; you can configure the router at any place before the router gets called. However, if you want to do it using Zend_Application, you need to see the documentation on Zend_App.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> say it is deprecated. All I said is that since there's a Resource Plugin shipped with ZF that does the configuring of the router for you, there's no sense in having an initRouter() method in your bootstrap.</p>

<p>That assumes the documentation will be updated according to this issue.</p>

<p>It needs to be there so new ZF developers don't waste time and can configure the router without searching unofficial sources for 10 minutes.  Just a link to the Zend_Application section would be enough to prevent this.</p>

<p>Please help me out, being a new developer to ZF, as I had already run through the quick start guide you linked.</p>

<p>Where does it mention routes and where they should live?</p>

            <p>I agree with Dolf on this one:  The quickstart isn't meant to enumerate everything you can do with Zend Framework, just provide the basic introduction on how to get a basic application up and running.  The question is, where does one draw the line?  configuring routes? sessions? cache? Lucene search?  As it's meant to provide the most basic of introductions, it's best that we keep it simple, and any developers who want to do more will undoubtedly start consulting the manual section for each module they want to know more about.</p>

<p>That, and IMO the quick-start will become less and less relevant at this late stage in ZFv1's lifecycle as most people looking to pick up ZF from scratch will choose ZF2 over ZF1.</p>

<p>Recommend closing as "Won't Fix"</p>
