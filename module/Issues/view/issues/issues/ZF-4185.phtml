    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_View_Helper_Action explicitly returns an empty string when the request has been forwarded or redirected. I can understand why a redierct would result in empty output, but I cannot understand why a forwarded request is also ignored.</p>

<p>In Zend/View/Helper/Action.php</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if (!$this-&gt;request-&gt;isDispatched() || $this-&gt;response-&gt;isRedirect())  { 
  // forwards and redirects render nothing 
  return ''; 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>I use the action helper to build componentized pages, and the issue I have now is that the component I'm wanting takes into account the status of Zend_Auth. If the user is authenticated, then a form is rendered, otherwise a notice is rendered. Each outcome is handled by a different action in the controller, with another action to determine which should actually be called.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
class MyController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
  public function indexAction()
  {
    if (Zend_Auth::getInstance()-&gt;hasIdentity()) {
      $this-&gt;_forward('authenticated');
    } else {
      $this-&gt;_forward('not-authenticated');
    }
  }
  public function authenticatedAction()
  { /* render form */ }
  public function notAuthenticatedAction()
  { /* render notice */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's entirely possible there's a reason I can't see why forwarded requests should be ignored. This may be a FE rather than a Bug.</p>

<p>Besides writing another action helper, I can't see a workaround, so classed as major.</p>

            <p>The assumption is that if your action forwards to another action, the content is incomplete. However, I can see your point as well, and am scheduling this change for the next mini release.</p>

            <p>Actually, given your example, changing this would have no effect. The action() helper does not follow _forward() requests, and this is by design. As a result, this means that what you are wanting to achieve simply wouldn't work anyways.</p>

<p>Additionally, the ViewRenderer does not render a view when a _forward() request is detected -- which means you would need to manually inject your generated content into the response object.</p>
