    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Search result highlighting in ZEND Lucene is a problem.</p>

<p>The way Lucene gathers to be highlighted strings, by cascading through internal <em>highlightMatches() methods in all the different Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query</em>... classes, often re-tokenizing the entire to be highlighted text, is very slow, error prone, and usually duplicates code from the rewrite() methods in the same classes.</p>

<p>This method of doing things is also is a blocker for some nifty features I did with other patches, dealing with multi-token ability (among th cool features related to stem and synonym searches that are listed in the current code behind @todo: lines) since they require calls to the rewrite() method of newly created sub queries, which is no problem when coming from a rewrite() method, but does not work within  _highlightMatches() due to the unavailability of an indexer.</p>

<p>No longer !</p>

<p>This patch re-designs how highlighting terms are gathered, simply using rewrite()-&gt;getQueryTerms().</p>

<p>To be able to rewrite in the first place, the to be highlighted text needs to be stored in an index.
While in 99.99% of all cases those texts would be in the main search index, the class definition calls for the highlight function to be index independent.</p>

<p>Rightfully so :)</p>

<p>Therefore I wrote a "dummy index class", which implements the whole Zend_Search_Lucene_Interface, but does not write to a real Lucene index on disk, instead stores an index simulated by PHP assotiative arrays in memory.</p>

<p>class Zend_Search_Lucene_TempIndex</p>

<p>I gave Query-&gt;highlightMatches an optional 5th parameter to supply a different index to be used in rewrite(). Without that, the TempIndex is instantiated, the to be highlighted document added with -&gt;addDocument, and then used for rewrite().</p>

<p>Then I removed all the _highlightMatches() functions from all Query Classes ;)</p>

<p>Regards</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>While reading ZF-2598 I just noticed that it might be necessary to use a different analyzer for indexing of the to-be highlighted text and for rewrite()-ing the search query to get the highlighting tokens.</p>

<p>Would it make sense to give $query-&gt;highlightMatches() an additional parameter to override the analyzer used to tokenize the html string?</p>

<p>What do you think? Would be an easy enough change to this patch.</p>

            <p>Bug has been closed by default in "Bulk change". However patch is already attached to bug, what has been missing is a maintainer</p>
