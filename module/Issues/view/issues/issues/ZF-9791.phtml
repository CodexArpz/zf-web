    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to access to the current Zend_Form object from any Zend_Form_Element or Zend_Form_Decorator (a getForm method...)
I'm made some change into  Zend_Form_Decorator_Description class to handle variables in a "sprintf style". Unfortunately I can get only the current element value and can't access to all form context :( ...</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Sébastian, thought about implementing this too, because of the Notation handling when rendering names,
i thought about setting the member $_form when attaching an element or form to a existing form, *but*
there is a drawback - s/o will try setting the $_form member on an already attached element which then
requires many actions to be proxied - resetting belongsTo, assurance that the name is not token within
the new parent form, removing the element and all settings from the previous form, and so on ...
I mean there is much to take care about, so that i am not willing at the moment to implement this,
and i have something cooking, at that... ZF-9516 (be warned it is chaotic)</p>
