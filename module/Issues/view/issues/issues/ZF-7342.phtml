    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>On the constructor the class variable "$this-&gt;_bigEndian" is hardcoded with a "1" value, on 64 Bits processors this convert the float values incorrectly because the method "writeDouble" execute a strrev($stream), with that all the float values are displayed as 0.40998789798-E123 for example</p>

<p>I detected that on the constructor is the following sentence:</p>

<p>$testEndian  = unpack("C<em>", pack("S</em>", 256));</p>

<p>and following is: $this-&gt;_bigEndian    = 1;</p>

<p>that I believe that the intention is to detect the endian on the server but it was never used</p>

<p>I changed the line with $this-&gt;_bigEndian    = 1;</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>$this-&gt;_bigEndian    = $testEndian[2];</p>

<p>Please verify if the solution is correct, I tested on my both environments:</p>

<p>My Linux box running:   Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.2.6</p>

<p>My Solaris Box 64bits:  Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) PHP/5.2.9</p>

<p>Let me know if you need more details and If I can help documenting this</p>

            <p>I don't know how your change will work correctly because on readDouble the byte order wasn't tested before reverting the stream.
Additionally this will set bigEndian to 1 on little endian systems.</p>

            <p>I tested on both environments little endian and big endian, we have been working that way for months and we didn't had a problem</p>

            <p>I added a patch.</p>

<p>Can you run Zend_Amf_AllTests with the applied patch and test if this working for you please.</p>

<p>thx</p>

            <p>I see that the patch was committed to trunk but there was no test case commit to trunk. Do you plan on committing a test?</p>

            <p>I have run AllTests with this patch on   64 and 32 bit system and everything passes. We should really add a patch for when it would fail so that people know to upgrade. I am going to promote the change to the next release.</p>

            <p>Hi Wade,</p>

<p>This hadn't do anything with 32/64bit but with little/big endian systems.</p>

<p>I haven't got an big-endian (e.g Solaris, SPARC) system to test it by my self.
But after viewing i think the tests didn't fail on big endian systems.</p>

            <p>I personally don't have access to anything without intel inside so thanks for making the patch!</p>
