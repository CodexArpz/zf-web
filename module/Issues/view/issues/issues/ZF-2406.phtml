    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Please consider adding api doc to the ZF snapshots. As the manual is there, it seems a little incomplete to me and I find the api documentation  very handy.</p>

<p>I tried to build it myself with phpDocumentor. It failed with an out of memory message. On upping the memory I discovered it made no difference to the limit and it turns out that my version of php 5.2.0-8+etch9 from the Debian stable distribution has memory_limit disabled unless compiled with the an option to enable it (see: <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40023&amp;edit=1">http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40023&amp;edit=1</a>). i guess the Debian packagers are unaware of this oddity.</p>

<p>I cannot build the api docs myself unless I upgrade to Debian mixed/testing distribution. I don't want to do that as I've been repeatedly burnt by running mixed levels in the past and it would also break my test server's parity with my live server which is pure stable. The only other alternative I can imagine is compiling PHP from source with the necessary configure option but I know that hits other known bugs for the extensions I wish to run from a Debian stable environment.</p>

<p>So including api doc would certainly help me and out and any other stable Debian users in this situation until php5.2.4 reaches Debian stable where memory_limit enabled again. I think it would also be generally more convenient all round to do this.</p>
