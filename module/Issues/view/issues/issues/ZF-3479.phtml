    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p><em>What steps will reproduce the problem?</em>
Fetch a message from a POP3 server where the email-body contains a single line with a dot ("."). For example (sent by the groups.google.com-Google Maps API):

<h2>Looking for example - Can this be done? - 2 new</h2>

<p>I have a google map on a web page. I would like for the user to enter in a=

state and hit submit. Using AJAX, I want to be able to access a database on=

</p>

<p><em>What is the expected output?</em>
The class will read the message from the server until the termination octet (wrapped in CRLF: "\r\n.\r\n") occurs.</p>

<p><em>What do you see instead?</em>
The class will read the message and return only the contents until the single line with the dot "." appears. Apparently, it is not parsing the termination octet as returned by the server correctly and assumes that any line in a message containing only a dot "." represents a termination octet.</p>

<p><em>Can you provide a fix for this problem?</em>
In line 188 in Zend/mail/Protocol/Pop3.php, replace</p>

<p>[code]
while ($line &amp;&amp; trim($line) != '.') {
[/code]</p>

<p>with</p>

<p>[code]
while ($line &amp;&amp; $line != ".\r\n") {

        <div class="body">
            <p>After rereading the RFC, the proposed patch is not correct or won't fix the problem. The trim should only remove \r and \n, but it's used to avoid problems with non-conforming servers (like ones that terminate lines with only \n).</p>

<p>Now the problem is, that a valid message with a single dot in a line would still have ".\r\n" and that's the same as the line with the termination octet. The server should send "..\r\n" (and Zend_Mail_Protocol_Pop3 should remove the first dot), but it seems like your POP3 server isn't careful enough.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The termination octet is now handled correctly ("..\r\n" becomes ".\r\n" in the message body).</p>

<p>The question remains, which wrong RFC violation we should support in addition. IMO wrong newlines are more common and therefor supporting "\n" or and other combination of "\r" and "\n" more important, than a server, that does not escape a line with a single dot correctly. I leave this task open for comments.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>This bug still exists in the 1.6 branch (revision 12162).</p>

<p>In my instance, the subject line wraps and has a single '.' on the end - which after the trim gets interpreted as part of the POP3 protocol.</p>

<p>i.e. This is what I see when I telnet into the cyrus pop3 server and fetch the problem message :</p>

<p>Note, the single full stop/period which is on the line AFTER the subject: - and it is indented correctly.</p>

<p>When trying to parse the above, the class fails with an unhelpful message of 'cannot retrieve message' - and ends up thinking 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed;' is the response to the previous command.....</p>

<p>Maybe you could post your message source with all chars printed, including \r and \n - at least the snippet from your last comment.</p>
