    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The unit test suite for Zend_Service_Simpy should have the capability to run offline. Typically this involves capturing responses from the service provider to files and adding these files to SVN for use with the test suite. See other test suites for more specifics on how this can be done.</p>

            <p>Alex, please evaluate and decide whether we should fix this. If it is worth fixing, please contact the author of Simpy to see if she/he will fix it.</p>

            <p>I'm working on separating the test suite out into both online and offline versions. I've run into an issue with Simpy itself that prevents some tests from running reliably and contacted its maintainer but as of yet have received no response. Copies of the communications are included below.</p>

Subject: Simpy Delete Link Bug?
From: Matthew Turland <a href="mailto:tobias382@gmail.com">tobias382@gmail.com</a>
To: Otis Gospodnetic <a href="mailto:otis@simpy.com">otis@simpy.com</a></p>

<p>Hey Otis,</p>

<p>I'm having an issue deleting links on Simpy, both from the web
interface and through the API. If you look under the syapizend
account, you should see a single bookmark for
<a href="http://framework.zend.com">http://framework.zend.com</a>. Attempts to delete this link from the web
interface appear to work as normal up to the point where the page
refreshes, when the link is still shown despite the deletion attempt.
The API returns the response shown below, also appearing to indicate
that all is well, but a subsequent call to GetLinks shows the link to
still be present. Any ideas on what could be causing this issue?
Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;

Link deleted successfully.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hey Otis,</p>

<p>Another issue that came up after I'd already sent the previous e-mail:
when I attempt to edit this link, I get the following.</p>

<p>Who Stole my Mojo!? (read: ooops, something broke)
An error has occurred. This may be a temporary error. Please go back
and try again. If the error persists, please let us know.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is an issue with the search index being out of sync with
data storage? Please keep me apprised of what you find out.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Matt

@otisg Sent you an e-mail regarding a Simpy issue about 5 days ago. Should I be sending it elsewhere these days?

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>All clear now - your account's underlying bookmark index needed reindexing, that's all.
Note that I replied to you.... I think it was over IM, so maybe you didn't get my message.</p>
