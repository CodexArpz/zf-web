    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I have find this bug when writing unit tests. After resetting front controller, redirector helper still existed, with all redirection params set earlier.
I had to manually reset redirector before every test.</p>

<p>In my opinion when resetting FrontControllers all helpers should be cleared too\ - this would help much in unit testing of controllers.</p>

            <p>It's a larger and more complicated issue...</p>

<p>I have meet many issues concerning unit testing and static variables in plugins/helpers/etc that will perstist after executing Zend_Controller_Front::resetInstance() or Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::resetHelpers(); which can in some situations return outdated data  or behave in unexpectable way.</p>

<p>For example (unit testing):</p>

<p>My application is using Zend_Layout.</p>

<p>// test #1 starts here</p>

<p>When Zend_Layout::startMvc(array()) is called for the first time it will :
- create sigleton instance
- register Zend_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout in front controller
- register helper Zend_Layout_Controller_Action_Helper_Layout</p>

<p>So far everything wotks brilliant....</p>

<p>Lets say I start next test from PHPUnit test suite, bu t before I do it I call $front-&gt;resetInstance() and Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::resetHelpers(); to reset environment.
After this I will launch code which will set up front controller from scratch, just like was done when application was started.
Zend_Layout::startMvc(array()) will be launched again, but Zend_Layout will notice that its singleton was already instantiated, so it won't register Zend_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout in front controller anymore.</p>

<p>// test #2 starts here</p>

<p>When secont unittest will be starter, there will be no Zend_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout plugin registered in front controller - it's not what we would expect.</p>

<p>There are similar issues with other plugins and helpers, I wonder wheter to file similar bugs or on generic called "Unit testing, ZF - unable to reset environment completely".</p>

<p>What's your feelings about this issue?</p>

<p>PS.
Running unit tests as separate processes would resolve my problems but so far it's not possible with PHPUnit (this functionality is in unstable branch).</p>

            <p>I've added a call to the helper broker's resetHelpers() method within Z_C_F's resetInstance(). Additionally, we now have the Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase, which provides infrastructure for testing and solves most (if not all) issues reported.</p>

<p>Changes are current as of r10111.</p>
