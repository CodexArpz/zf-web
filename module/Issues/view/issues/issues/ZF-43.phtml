    <h3>Description</h3>

<p>We need unit tests for the entire Zend_Db sub tree. The attached patch provides a first cut at testing the Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_* sub tree.</p>

<p>I've concentrated more on the structure for the tests and have covered some of the simple cases. (It also picks up the error described in #32).</p>

<p>I would appreciate comments especially on the layout of the test files.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>unit tests for Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_* v1

<p>Note that the attached patch was created from within the tests subdirectory.
05/07/06 15:42:26: Modified by rob.nospam@akrabat.com</p>

<p>Notes from email sent to fw-general list:</p>

<p>The main test files are tests/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/MssqlTest.php and MysqlTest.php. The classes are Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_MssqlTest and Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_MysqlTest respectively.</p>

<p>Both these classes inherit from Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Common which is an abstract (empty) class that inherits from Zend_Db_Adapter_Common.</p>

<p>Zend_Db_Adapter_Common is an abstract class that inherits from PHPUnit2_Framework_TestCase. It contains common set up code to create and drop a test table (actual SQL required delegated down to the concrete classes). It also contains tests for functionality that should work regardless of the concrete Adapter used, such as testing insert.

<p>When the patch is integrated into the next release, also make sure we have coverage to detect problems like those in #102.</p>

            <p>Help needed!  Volunteers wanted!</p>

<p>We need to update the patch to reflect changes, and expand coverage.
Also, test covering resolved issues need to be added.</p>

            <p>db_tests2.patch is a diff against revision 845.</p>

<p>I created this patch file using svn diff &gt; db_tests2.patch from the trunk/tests directory, but I can't get it to apply to a clean tree!</p>

<p>This is the result:</p>

<p>ralle@robnb /c/wwwroot/php_include/zf_trunk_tmp/tests
$ patch --dry-run  &lt; db_tests2.patch<br />

<p>It seems like it tries to patch tests/AllTests.php rather than tests/Zend/AllTests.php and I've no idea why.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to get patch.exe to apply this diff or is there another way to do it?</p>

            <p>Another attempt at a patch that can be applied... (Thanks Gavin!). This patch is against revision 855.</p>

<p>To apply, copy db_patch3.patch to trunk/ and then from the trunk/ directory, type:</p>

<p>$ patch -p0 &lt; db_patch3.patch</p>

            <p>I have just created the unit tests for Pdo_Sqlite, I dont think I can easily create a patch for this since the starting unit tests are not in the repository.</p>

<p>A quick comment on the tests</p>

<p>$suite-&gt;addTestSuite('Zend_DbTest');</p>

<p>Is spaced using tabs not spaces.</p>

<p>Can we get this patch checked into trunk so we can start creating patches for futher unit tests?</p>
