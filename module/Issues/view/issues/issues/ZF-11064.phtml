    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When setting the config option "logUntranslated" to true, all untranslated are writte to the specified logger like expected.</p>

<p>BUT in Zend_Translate_Adapter, method setOptions (line 331):
in the foreach the variable $change is set always true, so a write to the cache is performed.</p>

<p>See attachments for more information (profiler and patch)</p>

            <p>The method setOptions() is called only once... by the constructor of the translation adapter. See line 177.</p>

<p>When the method is called multiple times within your environment it would mean that you are creating multiple adapters by calling the constructor multiple times.</p>

<p>The second thing to mention is that the cache is only written when a option has been changed and this option is not 'locale'. See the lines 340 and 342.</p>

            <p>The responsible key is "log" not locale, that the variable $change is set always to true (see my attached patch).</p>

<p>The __construct() is only called only one time.</p>

<p>This seems to be the problem:
The option "logUntranslated" is set to true in my options and in this profiler screenshots is a untranslated string.
So the log writer will write the untranslated string to the logfile (which is a change...), but for the cache nothing has really changed (but it gets written new for nothing).</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The problem is not that __construct() is called only once.
Calling it multiple times would mean to create multiple instances of Zend_Translate.</p>

<p>Also your pictures do not show that the cache is written multiple times.
It is only written once after __construct() has been called.</p>

<p>With actual informations I can not reproduce that the cache is written every time when an untranslated string has been added to the log.</p>

            <p>It seems we missunderstood each other.</p>

<p>The cache is not written multiple times, it's only writte once per request.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>the write to the cache is not necessary, because the translation content itself has not changed! 
Why should the cache get written, only because a log entry is written somewhere else?</p>
