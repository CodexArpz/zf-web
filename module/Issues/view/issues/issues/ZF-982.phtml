    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Date's get() currently accepts both Zend_Date constants and PHP format specifiers, but not ISO specifiers.  When PHP format specifiers are used with get(), the resulting output is not localized (i.e. the output is wrong in the eyes of users).  We could merge get() and toString(), but I see little value and several negative effects of merging.</p>

<p>I propose to fix this inconsistency (lack of support for ISO, defaulting to ISO) by removing support for format specifiers from get().</p>

<p>Instead, developers would use toString() when working with format specifiers, and they would use get() when working with Zend_Date constants corresponding to date parts.  I also propose changing the name of get() to something more descriptive, such as {{getDatePart()}}.   I will add something to the testGet() unit test to help track this issue.</p>

            <p>See SVN 3662.</p>

<p>get() now supports Zend_Date constants and php and iso format strings.
If no constant is given, toString() is called instead of processing it further within get().</p>

<p>This way the problem mentioned above does not exist anymore.</p>

            <p>If toString() works, why add the formatting features of toString() to get()?</p>

<p>Why would developers ever use toString(), if get() does everything toString() does and more?</p>

            <p>A user will probably use get() to get some return values from the actual date object.</p>

<p>A user would probably use toString() when he want to have string output of the date object.
Also toString() is called automatically by php... __toString();</p>

<p>get() is also used by object creation, because the original approach was to use the constants...
Then you proposed also to have single strings parsed by object creation... so get() was extended to support
iso strings additionaly to constants... and then you said other strings should also be supported... now all possible ways are recognised by get(). And now you say this is not good ???</p>

<p>In my opinion it's good to have the functionallity seperated... toString() returns formatted strings only... get() calculates constants only... but on failure the function degrades to toString() and tries to generate the proper output.</p>

<p>I see no negative or problems on this approach.</p>

            <p>I never proposed extending get, just making "new Zend_Date()" work with format specifiers.</p>

<p>The negative comes from having two ways to do the same thing.  On other issues, the devteam often prefers to try and provide "one way" to do each task, without losing flexibility for users to change things.  One of the reasons given for the "one way" preference is to help avoid confusion among developers regarding which way to use under what circumstances.</p>

            <p>Well.... we have the standard toString function which should be implemented because this is the standard way of getting output from an object.</p>

<p>And we have the complete tree of get() functions. getDate(), getTime(), getHour() and so on...
which are just a simplification for the default get() to simplify the useage of get().</p>

<p>When we delete get() we would corrupt the API and have to rename all getxxx functions to toxxx functions... which does not describe exact what they are doing.</p>

<p>If we delete the toString() function we have other problems... one is the objects standard toString() function... the second is that toString does exactly what it should... it converts an date object TO-STRING().</p>

<p>I see no problems in having both functions implemented and to auto-correct false input from the user for the get() function.</p>

<p>Btw:
toString() can not work with the constants... this only works with the get() function. So this functions are not doing the same... get() is just failsave for userinput.</p>

            <p>As discussed in the community server, this issue is no longer a problem as with SVN 3697.</p>

<p>All related unit tests work.
If we find any problems we can reopen this issue anytime.</p>
