            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Are you encountering some troubles which can be reproduced? Or is this a best-practice suggestion?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Shahar.</p>

            <p>No I haven't troubles. I have found it by chance.</p>

<p>To uncompress deflated data the function gzinflate must use. (php.net: gzinflate â€” Inflate a deflated string)
To uncompress data compressed by gzcompress the function gzuncompress (php.net: Uncompress a compressed string)</p>

<p>Or does I doing wrong ?</p>

            <p>Well, since the compression support in Zend_Http_Client went through allot of testing and is being used in production, I am going to hold this off in lower priority. I will review if this is somehow problematic when the time is right, but for now, since it is working, I don't see any point in fixing it.</p>

            <p>I am not sure why, but this seems to be the correct way to reverse both compression algorithms. I am closing this for now as it does work and I couldn't get it to work just by using the functions you suggest.</p>

<p>If you encounter any problems or have a working patch which is somehow better, please reopen this bug.</p>

            <p>I did encounter and issue using windows live contacts api. The results is returned with encoding "deflate" and using gzuncompress returns false while gzinflate decompresses it correctly.</p>
