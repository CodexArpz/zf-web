    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am having troubled with attachments when sending to AT&amp;T (Cingular) MM3 Email-to-MMS gateway via SMTP. Unfortunately the gateway's software is a black box to me, but the result that it "removed corrupted mime part image/jpeg".</p>

<p>$mail-&gt;createAttachment($data['image'], 'image/jpeg', Zend_Mime::DISPOSITION_INLINE, Zend_Mime::ENCODING_BASE64, $message-&gt;id."-img.jpg");</p>

<p>$data['image'] is the result of imagejpeg().</p>

<p>All this works really well with PEAR::Mail. I have played around with changing line end characters and changing the line length, but it does not solve anything.</p>

<p>Mail.app on Mac and Outlook on Windows can read the attachments, but when I save it from Exchange Webmail, it seems a little corrupted too (maybe because that front-end is not that smart to correct errors.)</p>

<p>Something seems fishy in Zend_Mime or Zend_Mail_Smtp and I cannot figure it out.</p>

            <p>The problem seems to occur not always but rather sporadically. Unfortunately I cannot say under which circumstances the attachment gets corrupted. When I run the very same code several times, most of the times everything works as expected, but sometimes the attachment is broken. Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Fixed with r12343.
Changed linelength to 72 to be compatible with other mailers.</p>

<p>Seems to be related to ZF-4360 and ZF-4169.
Feel free to reopen if it is not fixed for your environment.</p>
