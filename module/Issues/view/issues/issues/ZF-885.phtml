    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, there is no extremely easy way to choose some of the most popular date formats, like "Y/m/d" or "Y-m-d H:i: s".</p>

<p>I suggest adding these to the "additional date format" constants (and support for these).</p>

            <p>All of this formats can be parsed by using the constant ISO_8601.
They are noted in ISO convention and ISO is the standard constant for parsing those dates.</p>

<p>I would not add more constants if it's not really needed.
We already have 50 constants.</p>

<p>Btw:
I never heared of a "Y/m/d" format, and the second one is SQL format.
SQL was depreciated by the devteam when I wrote my proposal. I would have added it, but so it is accepted by ISO_8601...</p>

<p>When someone wants a "popular" format he likes and which is not supported he always can do this with toString();...
I would se no limitations from that...</p>

<p>Your opinon ?</p>

            <p>Right. This problem can partly be solved by documentation.
Reassigning to me ...</p>

            <p>If you have a date string in the format of Year-Month-Day, or "Year-Month-Day hour minute second", then use:</p>

<p>$date = new Zend_Date($inputString, Zend_Date::ISO_8601);</p>

<p>See FishEye link for additional documentation added to the manual.</p>
