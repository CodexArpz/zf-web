    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>ZendFramework-1.10.2\library\Zend\Tool\Framework\Client\Console
ArgumentParser.php
line: 120</p>

<pre><code>// check to see if the first cli arg is the script name
    if ($this-&gt;_argumentsWorking[0] == $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME' ]) {

        array_shift($this-&gt;_argumentsWorking);

    } 
</code></pre>

<p>Here you use $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] global variable in the CLI environment, 
but if you look in the PHP Manual 
(<a href="http://php.net/manualen/reserved.variables.server.php">http://php.net/manualen/…</a>), 
at the INDICES part, you will find the text saying: 
        "You may or may not find any of the following elements in $_SERVER. Note that few, if any, of these will be available (or indeed have any meaning)if running PHP on the command line. "</p>

<p>When i tried to run the zf.sh i got the error "Action '.../zf.php' is not a valid action."
This was because $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is NULL in the CLI environment.
But when i removed the "if" statement (as you can see below), then it worked just fine and I was able to run the "zf show version" command without errors.
    // check to see if the first cli arg is the script name
              array_shift($this-&gt;_argumentsWorking);</p>

            <p>I just hit this problem on one of my boxes. The server is running CentOS 5.5, and also the fcgi version of PHP (not sure if that is relevant - version in this case is 5.2.14). SCRIPT_NAME is set when using PHP normally, but from the command line the variable is null, as in the reporter's case.</p>

<p>Perhaps a reasonable fix, if $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] is not set, would be to check if the first argument ends with 'zf.php'.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any more environment info or a fix tested.</p>

            <p>Okay, this was actually a configuration problem on my side. Because of an incorrect path I'd put in, zf.sh was picking up the normal PHP binary instead of the php-cli. So that may well be the cause if anyone else hits this issue.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fix suggested above could be put in anyway, or if SCRIPT_NAME should always be available to php-cli then an error could be output if it is null, just to help debug problems like this.</p>
