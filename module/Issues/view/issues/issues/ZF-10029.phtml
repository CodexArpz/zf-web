    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In Poland there is use comma "," insted of dot "." in numbers.
Zend_Currency correctly shows values but I can not set number as string with comma.</p>

<p>I use locale 'pl_PL' and PLN.</p>

<p>$curr-&gt;setValue('123,45'); //as string</p>

<p>ps</p>

            <p>Closing as non-issue.</p>

<p>According to the manual and the API setValue() accepts:
* integer
* float
* Zend_Currency</p>

<p>A localized string is no valid input. When you want to give a localized string as value then you need to normalize it before or extend Zend_Currency to do this.</p>

<p>Reason: "value" is internally a float.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I think that it shoud be dependet from locale settings at all.</p>

<p>Keep on mind that showing currency is with locale settings:
in pl_PL locale
 $curr-&gt;setValue('123.45'); //value must be set with dot, I can't set value with comma
echo $curr; // 123,45 - always print comma = correct for Poland</p>

<p>It's illogical.</p>

<p>Value should be set directly (without changes) from forms.</p>

<p>Notice. Numeric keyborad (right side of keyboard) in polish standard has got comma insted of dot. It's default for us. Writing float numbers with dot is problematic.</p>

<p>"Value" should be internally a float, as is.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Again:
A string is not accepted as input. You need to make a float.</p>

<p>You can set it from within a form... add a filter.</p>

<p>Also your notice is not logical... when you use a polish keyboard we can also expect that your environment locale is polish which means that PHP itself does the conversion for you. When not: Add a filter.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>You are right that I can use filter. It can solve my problem but it is one more thing to remember while creating form. As well I can use str_replace(',','.',$str);</p>

<p>All incoming data from forms are strings.
Float numbers contains comma insted of dot.
Simple conversion done by the Zend_Currency ($val = floatval( $val );) gives me only an integer part of that string.</p>

<p>As you said I can use filters, but it would be more convenient if the class did it automatically based on Zend_Locale.</p>

<p>If you think I am wrong you can close this ticket.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>You can use this:</p>

<p>{quote}
$filter = new Zend_Filter_LocalizedToNormalized();
$filter-&gt;filter('53,95);
{quote}</p>

<p>It returns a string:</p>

<p>53.95</p>
