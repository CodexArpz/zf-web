        <p>GLOB_BRACE is used for a glob() call in the ConfigListener when merging configurations.
This dependency cannot be met on all operating systems, particularly AIX (IBMi).</p>

<p>An application using the ConfigListener fails with a fatal error:</p>

            <p>This looks kinda old. Evan, didn't we switch to \GlobIterator for that reason?</p>

<p>By the way, Yonni, did you test with the current beta3 or an old version?</p>

            <p>Tested with beta3, found a TODO in ConfigListener so I took it up with Matthew. According to him globiterators were inapplicable, so I applied a simpler solution.</p>

            <p>I had discussed this with Matthew and others on IRC. We discovered that \GlobIterator didn't solve the issue like we had anticipated it would (it doesn't support GLOB_BRACE at all, actually).</p>

<p>IIRC, Matthew was thinking GLOB_BRACE wouldn't work on Windows, but it turns out it does. It seems to only be non-GNU systems like Solaris that don't support it and I think the consensus was that people on those systems can easily change the glob pattern (and we could document such). Though, I'm unsure if passing GLOB_BRACE as a flag throws a warning or anything on non-GNU systems. Anyway, I suppose I don't mind changing this to two globs though simply to maintain a higher level of compatibility if there's no objections.</p>

            <p>I could come up with a fallback solution so GLOB_BRACE can still be used, even on non-GNU systems.</p>

            <p>One more problematic point:
AIX glob calls seem to ignore cwd - I can only get correct results when we use an absolute path.
When testing, I verified with getcwd that we are in the document root, etc...</p>

            <p>I'm not really sure there's much we can do to fix the AIX glob cwd issue...</p>

<p>It would seem to me that there are three options in this case:</p>

<p>1) Simply adjust the glob paths to be absolute after cloning the skeleton.
2) Use Zend\Module\Listener\ConfigListener::addConfigStaticPaths() to add each config file explicitly instead of addConfigGlobPaths() to add glob patterns.
3) Re-implement glob() completely in PHP, which I'd prefer we not do.</p>

            <p>The fix in PR 983 seem to work when I tested it in our IBMi machine but I had to create absolute paths for it to work. It seems that AIX glob works only with static paths - otherwise you get empty results and an empty configuration.</p>

<p>Should this issue be reopened for this? or should I create a new issue?</p>

            <p>I'm re-opening and assigning to Ben Scholzen. Perhaps there is something he can add to our Zend\Stdlib\Glob class to account for this.</p>
