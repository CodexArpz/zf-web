    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I brought this up briefly on the list but I thought I would submit a formal issue for it.</p>

<p>I think _rewriteBase should be automatically prepended to the routes.  On applications that would be distributed via download it would be easier to define generic routes.  An application with routes like:</p>

<p>/user/:id
/news/:action/:id</p>

<p>would never require a base path to be set in a config file or anything, as opposed to</p>

<p>{$settings-&gt;basePath}/user/:id
{$settings-&gt;basePath}/news/:action/:id</p>

<p>You'd have to do a few checks for beginning slashes, but I think it would be a neat change coupled with the automatic _rewriteBase detection that was recently added.</p>

            <p>RewriteBase should never be prepended to your routing rules. RewriteBase is automaticaly removed from a path before calculating route matches.</p>

<p>Everything you were required to do was to set a correct rewrite base and set the rules without it. Thanks to todays commit you don't have to set it anymore as it is detected and set automaticaly.</p>
