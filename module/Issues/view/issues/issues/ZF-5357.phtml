    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There is a bug in Zend_Form_Element_File class.</p>

<p>If you are want to upload a file, you get back a error message.
You get it back every time and no upload will be finished.</p>

<p>Here is my code from a form:</p>

<p>$foo = new Zend_Form_Element_File('foo');
$foo-&gt;setLabel('Choose a image:')
        -&gt;setDestination("/var/www/zend_quick/public");
$foo-&gt;addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif');</p>

<p>$this-&gt;addElement($foo);</p>

<p>from the controller:</p>

<p>if($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;isPost() == true) {</p>

<p>if (!$form-&gt;foo-&gt;receive()) {
              print "error";
}
}</p>

<p>then I get back some error messages.</p>

<p>1.) The file '' was not found
2.) Notice: Undefined index: tmp_name in /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 589
3.)Notice: Undefined index: name in /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/Validate/File/Extension.php on line 228</p>

<p>best regards</p>

            <p>PS: This failure comes for example when you forgot to set "multipart/form-data" on the form which means that the form does not support files to be uploaded.</p>

            <p>I got the same <a href="http://dayg.slingandstoneweb.com/2009/02/03/zend-framework-large-file-upload-issues/">Zend File Upload errors</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, I was uploading a file bigger than the allowable limit set in php.ini. This was fixed by updating post_max_size and upload_max_filesize.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Not with the actual release.</p>

<p>The configuration settings are checked and integrated into the form as MAX_FILE_SIZE element.
Your browser will then give a failure when the file extends this size.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>This problem occurs when the file pushes the complete POST body above the post_max_size threshold; the entire _POST and _FILES array are both empty.  Regular validators will handle this well, the file validators won't since the adapter tries to fetch the file content anyway. This should be checked by the adapter. I haven't had enough time to figure out where exactly this should be fixed, but it really is a pickle.</p>

            <p>This does not matter... the adapter checks this.
But as said in past you need to use the proper release.</p>

<p>This feature was added somewhere at 1.8.</p>

<p>Look into the Http adapter. When such an error occurs then the content length is 0 (as POST is empty).
So as soon as you try to receive a file, or validate it in such an case, then you will get false in return</p>
