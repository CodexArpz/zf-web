    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>1) There have been some changes concerning the available CDN's for Dojo. One has been added (Yandex), the other (AOL) has been "deprecated" for lack of a better word. They're having problems with AOL, rumors are the entire AOL CDN will be discontinued. The actual CDN is still active but Dojo has removed it from their site without any further notice or communication. I've contacted Peter Higgins and he'll provide some official word as soon he gets a hold of AOL (which seems to be difficult) so action can be taken. For the time being i'll add a diff/patch for the addition of Yandex.</p>

<p>2) The version that's bundled with zf (1.5.0), needs an upgrade to 1.6.1 (has been out for quite a while now) and so does the default CDN version (1.5.0). But that raises a problem: AOL. As said, they're having problems and don't have the 1.6.1. Dojo is not sure if they ever will. Pushing to 1.6.1 would break setups using AOL CDN. This could be avoided by doing a check in getCdnBase for the AOL CDN and force them to 1.5.0 and/or maybe throw notice/error. Not sure what proper protocol is here, please comment.</p>
