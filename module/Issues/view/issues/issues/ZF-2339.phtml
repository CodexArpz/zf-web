    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_View_Abstract::__construct() expects an array or an empty array but no type hint is given. "public function __construct(array $config = array())" would work quite well.</p>

            <p>Type-hinting to array would not allow us to later allow Zend_Config objects for configuring Zend_View (a change that is already being considered).</p>

            <p>Configuring Zend_View by passing an instance of Zend_Config to the constructor would introduce an incosistency with other framework components. In other components (such as Route, etc.pp) there are always special factories and setters for passing a configuration object. There is also an outstanding proposal to generalize that, Zend_Config_Configurable. On the other hand, configuring Zend_View with Zend_Config would nevertheless be possible, as Zend_Config::toArray() is present.</p>

<p>This is simply not true. There are a number of instances in the framework where constructors or factories <em>can</em> accept a Zend_Config object, and we are actually moving to support this in more places. In each case, we do <em>not</em> type hint, to allow passing arrays <em>or</em> Zend_Config objects (or, in some cases, scalar configuration). An excellent example of this paradigm is the new Zend_Form component.</p>

<p>The reason I have marked this as "Won't Fix" is so that we can support passing <em>either</em> arrays <em>or</em> a Zend_Config object.</p>
