    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In the docblock for Zend_Loader_PluginLoader::getClassName() (lines 298-303) the return value is given as</p>

<p>"@return string|false False if class not found, class name otherwise"</p>

<p>indicating that the plugin loader should be keeping track of plugins that fail to load. This doesn't happen, because in Zend_Loader_PluginLoader::load(), if the plugin is not found false is returned or an exception is thrown (lines 402 - 413) before the plugin tracking code (lines 415 - 419).</p>

<p>This could be resolved by putting the tracking code before the not found code.</p>

<p>I think a good idea would be to track the failed loads separately, so that failed loads can be tried again if a new prefix path was added. The number of new prefix paths added since a failed load could be tracked, and used to shorten the prefix paths to try in the loading code.</p>

<p>I'll put a file with my idea of a revised version of Zend_Loader_PluginLoader::load() for the simple solution. The more complicated, more tracking one I'll put up later after I've had some time to check it :).</p>

            <p>This will keep track of plugins that fail to load, but won't do any tracking to force the plugin loader to try again if a prefix path is added. I've got some code for that, but I want to check it a little more carefully than I can right now.</p>
