    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>cf ZF-9275 comments for a complete description of the problem including the defective source code.</p>

<p>The issue in ZF-9275 has not been fixed because of a bug in Zend/Form.php</p>

<p>Zend_Translate registry is set automatically by the resource method getTranslate
This in turn sets the translator for elements in Zend/Form/isValid() via the getDefaultTranslator method.
Since the element translator is initialized the Zend_Validate_Abstract default translator cannot be used.</p>

<p>Hence, the files in resources/languages/xx/Zend_Validate.php cannot be used normally unless using one of those workarounds:</p>

<ul><li>setting the validator translator file to Zend_Form default translators.</li>
<li>disabling the Zend_Translate registry setting.</li>
</ul><p>We should not see the forms elements translators override the validators translators since they address different translation sentences.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I don't see why this should be a problem of Zend_Translate?
Zend_Translate can not affect how other components behave.</p>

            <p>And why should Zend_Translate not use the registry key "Zend_Translate" ??</p>

<p>Zend_Cache uses the registry key "Zend_Cache"...
Zend_Locale uses the registry key "Zend_Locale"...</p>

<p>Generally all registry keys with "Zend_" are reserved for Zend_ component usage.</p>

<p>I still don't see the problem with Zend_Translate.</p>

            <p>I did not say it has to be deleted I say it has to stop overriding Zend_Validate_Abstract default translator.</p>

<p>Zend_Translate being set generates a bug which makes Zend_Form_Element translator override Zend_Validate_Abstract default translator. That doesn't mean it should be unset, only that the bug should be fixed.</p>

<p>Sorry this bug does not belong to only one component, it is an intricated bug that starts from the Boostrap and ends in Zend_Form/Element.</p>

<p>The way translators are handled is defective and leads to numerous problems since the approach is to give priority to some translators over others instead of a parallel approach which would favor reusability.</p>

<p>There should be a 'Zend_Translate' registry key only as a fallback, not something that would override other settings such as Zend_Validate_Abstract default translators.</p>

            <p>Closing as non issue.</p>

<p>You noted that Zend_Translate behaves buggy but you can not provide a usecase which shows this behaviour even after several replies.</p>

<p>Zend_Translate has nothing to do with the resources, Zend_Form, Zend_Validate or Zend_Application.</p>

<p>All of these classes which were mentioned make use of Zend_Translate and not reverse.</p>

<p>Zend_Translate itself can not affect how it is used by others or how other components behave. There is no way how Zend_Translate can change the usage of it's own registry key when this key is used by other components in an unexpected way.</p>

            <p>As mentioned before, you have the full description of the bug in ZF-9275 comments. The day you will use the components you design you will see what the problem is. As for me, I'm done reporting bugs for you.</p>

            <p>ZF-9275 is a bug of Zend_Form, not Zend_Translate.
I don't see how I can affect how Zend_Form behaves by changing Zend_Translate.</p>

<p>I am maintainer of Zend_Translate. And you stated in your issue and your second reply that there is a failure within Zend_Translate. When you see a bug within Zend_Form then you please add a issue for the this component with some code for reproducation and not for another component.</p>

<p>Note that I did not design Zend_Form. This is an "open source framework". Which means that people like me are giving their sparetime for others like you. I am not paid for this service nor for my sparetime. So there is no reason to get nasty.</p>

            <p>You are the maintainer of Zend_Translate then do me a favor: explain to other maintainers that there is no such things as 'priority' in translations. When a sentence is translated right I want to reuse it not see another translation override something that works.</p>

<p>You are giving free time I'm grateful because that bug is over 3 monthes old and still not fixed, yet it is classified as RESOLVED. People would be fired for that in a company.</p>

<p>The way it is analyzed is wrong, and even if it was right the code is also wrong.</p>

<p>I have described it well enough in ZF-9275 and also here, I don't see how opening another issue would get the problem fixed.</p>

<p>Another thing you could do would be to associate keywords to translations so things wouldn't be so confusing to other maintainers.</p>

I'm  not paid either to report bugs to developers like you. I spent many hours commenting on this issue, waited 3 monthes to see it fixed, I even listed the exact source code which is defective, you and other maintainers just have to look and fix the issue.</p>

<p>It sure would have been less a trouble to me to not report this issue and use a workaround. When you close an issue because it is referred as'Zend_Translate' instead of 'Zend_Form', it is disheartening to those who took time to report it and not helping to improve anything at all.</p>

<p>The issue is still here and I am not going to comment on it anymore.</p>
