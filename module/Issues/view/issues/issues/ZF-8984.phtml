    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>With php &lt; 5.3 and <em>xcache enabled</em> the Zend_Exception throws a Fatal Error as described on <a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Little-trouble-with-Zend-Framework-1-10-0-td1015190.html">Nabble</a>.</p>

<p><em>Disabling xcache or removing the else section</em> solves the problem but thats <em>not an acceptable resolution</em>.</p>

            <p>This is, quite simply, bad behavior on the part of xcache; other opcode caches, such as APC and Zend Optimizer, behave correctly with the conditional class definition.</p>

<p>I will attempt to resolve the issue, but you should also report it upstream to the xcache developers.</p>

            <p>Thanks. 
I opened a ticket in the xcache trac. <a href="http://xcache.lighttpd.net/ticket/234">Ticket #234</a></p>

            <p>It appears to be resolved in XCache 1.3.0.</p>

            <p>Since the issue was upstream, and the upstream provider has a release that corrects the issue, no further work needs to be done on the ZF side.</p>

<p>If you are using XCache and have the issue as reported, upgrade to XCache 1.3.0.</p>

            <p>We use Ubuntu 9.10 from an automated installation with stable packages and security updates. We have a policy to only use supported stable packages so I'm not able/allowed to use XCache &gt; 1.2.2 for now. 
Thank you for your efforts.</p>

            <p>We have the same problem. We removed not needed Zend_Exception class declaration from Zend/Exception.php to use ZF 1.10. Seems to be the only way at the moment.</p>

            <p>Another policy is: Do not to change the library to stay upgradable. 
;-)
So we are really not able to use it at all.</p>

            <p>@Andre: This change works under normal installs of PHP; the problem here is entirely in a 3rd party, unofficial extension to PHP -- and, as noted, newer releases to that extension correct the issue. We simply cannot target every possible extension combination possible to PHP.</p>

<p>If you are not using svn:externals, you can simply modify the library/Zend/Exception.php file to remove the condition.</p>

            <p>Thanks Matthew, but thats exactly how its implemented in your application  - as an svn:externals property in your library and it will be updated/exported in the build process. In development it's ok to remove the condition...</p>

            <p>Thanks for the path. I'll try it next week. End of this week we have a release and I don't think that it would make all happy to change the library shortly before that.

            <p>That patch would definitely solve the issue; I'll apply it today for the 1.10.1 release.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
