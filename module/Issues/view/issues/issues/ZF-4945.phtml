    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I just wanted to use Zend_File for a new project, and discovered a serious bug. After submitting a file, and if the validation of some other field fails, Zend_File adds the filename with number "0" as attribute name to the view helper, which then looks like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't really matter for HTML sites, but for XHTML the browser stops with a "not well-formed XML" message. Hence I consider this as a blocker.</p>

            <p>Do you use the file-view helper ?
Because this helper does not display the value of the element.</p>

<p>The reason for this problem is not the file component but the ViewHelper.
I was forced to add getValue to the form element because the form can not handle elements without value.
But the file element does not have a value in HTML.</p>

<p>I expect that you get the above output when you don't use the proper view helper or decorator.</p>

            <p>Here is the controller which creates the form and the class subclassing Zend_Form for decorators.</p>

            <p>Is there a reason why you erased the file validator from the file element ?
lines 77-98 in your form</p>

<p>This prevents the file element from being rendered correct because you erased the file decorator which is attached per default.</p>

<p>You would have the same problem when you add a image and delete the image decorator from the image element.</p>

            <p>Indeed that was it, exchainging the ViewHelper decorator with the File decorator for the File element fixed it. Probably this should be mentioned either in the docs that the Form_Element_File needs the File instead of the ViewHelper decorator, or even better let the File element see, if a ViewHelepr decorator was added, and automatically exchange it either with the File decorator or throw an exception.</p>

            <p>It is not possible to throw an exception.
The user must be able to give a own implementation of a file decorator.</p>

<p>The documentation mentions the file decorator.</p>

<p>It is only needed in some special cases.</p>

<ul><li>When you use XHTML</li>
<li>When you use Subforms</li>
<li>When you use MultiFiles</li>
</ul><p>A request to the author of Zend_Form regarding the problem of setDecorator for File, Images and other elements was until now not answered</p>
