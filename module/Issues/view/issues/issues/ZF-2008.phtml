    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>PHP does not support flexible parameters, so I see no reason why Zend_Currency does.
1) It makes the class very hard to extend its constructor.
2) <em>IF</em> you want to support it, the params should not be listed in function header (!) but derived from func_get_args() instead</p>

<p>Whole class is poorely written. Some coding standard-related problems:</p>

<p>1) Static vars should be used to keep track of long / short / symbol already retrieved from Zend_Locale_Data::getContent(). This will tune the performance up without need of using cache.
2) instead of bunch of those:
```
there should be protected method _getLocale(). This way class will be more extendable (if you use some My_Locale class you cannot integrate it here)
3) I wonder why to have all-in-one method setFormat() with two ways of using the $rules parameter (flexible params again?!) instead of setPosition() and setSign() ?</p>

            <p>hay Artur,
thank you for helping us get it bettter =) . yea, maybe we need to do some refactoring.</p>

<p>the flexible params were experimental, we wanted to see if this will be helping the users or what?, but there were no one complaining about this, so we kept it to see what will happen when Zend_Currency goes core.</p>

<p>I don't know, if we will save this data in static vars, I think it's better happen in Zend_Locale_Data .</p>

<p>what do you think?</p>

You are totally right, I didn't notice the Zend_Locale_Data actually has its current cache, sorry.</p>

<p>One more comment about the class:
```
It seems the 3rd argument (region) is not used in getContent for 'currencynames' path.</p>

<p>I don't really like the way the constructor is built. For example there's no need to get full name, symbol, format from Zend_Locale_data unless it's really needed - I'd rather see it in methods which uses them. Since there are no such methods (another issue I've posted), there's no easy way to refactor that.</p>

<p>Sorry for being harsh Ahmed, I'm just integrating the Zend_Currency with my project and that kind of real-life use case brings a lot of problems with the class. Thanks for creating it anyway :-)</p>
