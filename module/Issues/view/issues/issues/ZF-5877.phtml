    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Given a table with an auto-incrementing primary key column pkID, code like</p>

<p>$table=new TableClass_extending_Zend_Db_Table
$newRow=$table-&gt;createRow();
$newRow-&gt;pkID="";
$newRow-&gt;save();</p>

<p>will throw an exception 
Error: Cannot refresh row as parent is missing</p>

<p>This is relevant in forms with add/edit behaviour, where you may have a pkID field which is set if you wish to edit a row, but  not set to create a new row.  So code like
$newRow-&gt;setFromArray($form-&gt;getValues());
will set the primary key to a non-Null value and cause the save() to throw the exception.</p>

<p>You can obviously work around it in a number of ways, e.g. $newRow-&gt;pkID=NULL, but it is not desired behaviour.</p>

            <p>I'm happy to put together a patch &amp; test for this issue, if I get some guidance as to whether it's a feature or a bug.</p>

<p>Let me know if there's another place I should be asking this kind of question.</p>

            <p>Proposing to close this issue as not an issue. If you set the value of the PK to 0, it makes sense for zend_db_table_row to use that value as PK when refreshing.</p>

<p>Edit; for what the reporter of this issue is concerned, you can of course easilly override getValues() and add a detection for empty id's to be set to null etc.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I agree that there may be rare circumstances where you'd want the pkID to be set to zero, but are there any circumstances in real life where pkID should be set to an empty string?</p>

<p>Granted it's a convenience, but having a hidden pkID field set or not is a common paradigm for add/edit forms and it would be nice if it worked out the box.  If this isn't a good enough reason to make the change, then definitely mark it as a non-issue.</p>

            <p>Closing as not-an-issue. See Dolf's comment above.</p>
