    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi, In my application I have the necessity that the </p> html tag contains an (encoded) character like √, but at the moment that ZF Helper headTitle() write the  html tag, it escape what I have insert, so "√" became "&amp;#8730;", and this is not what I want.

<p>I think that this imposition is wrong.  I have to be able to choose whether I want that my </p> will be escaped or not.

<p>Tnx and sorry for my bad english.</p>

<p>UPDATE in reply to Ben S.: My problem is not the encoded version of my text, the problem is that headTtile() escape, via escape() function, the string that I need to use for the HTML'S TITLE tag. So I can not use noone characters that start with &amp; like TM, C, the checked V, α , &amp;beta etc etc etc.</p>

<p>M.</p>

            <p>I don't really think that this is a requirement. All components in Zf are layed out to work with UTF-8. So when your output is in UTF-8 (which it should), then you won't have to escape it that character. Problem solved.</p>
