    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm currently using ZF to write an application but I randomly get these errors:</p>

<p>Notice: iconv_substr() [function.iconv-substr]: Unknown error (12) in /library/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 783</p>

<p>I tried to search for this issue but I only found references to 'Unknown error(0)' here. I can't seem to reproduce this issue, it appears to be completely random.</p>

<p>Is this a known issue? Is there a way to avoid it?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>First:
What you receive is not an error, but only a notice. This means that the code still works properly, otherwise you should get an exception.</p>

<p>Second:
What you are receiving is a failure from PHP's iconv_substr method. And when even iconv_substr notes that it does not know what error occured, I believe that ZF is not able to fix this.</p>

<p>I would propose that you eighter look at PHP's bug database if the PHP release you are using has a known problem regarding iconv.</p>

<p>And I would look if the iconv library you installed is outdated.</p>

<p>Try to upgrade iconv and php to see if the error remains... still I am sad to say that without any further information we can impossibly react or reproduce this behaviour.</p>
