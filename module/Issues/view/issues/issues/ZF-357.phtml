    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There is some inconsistency between the Coding Standard Naming Convention requirements and the instructions for creating a view helper. The Naming Conventions state:</p>

<p>"IMPORTANT: Code that operates with the framework but is not part of the framework, e.g. code written by a framework end-user and not Zend or one of the framework's partner companies, must never start with "Zend_"."</p>

<p>However, the instructions for writing custom view helpers states:</p>

<p>" Writing custom helpers is easy; just follow these rules:
      The class name must be Zend_View_Helper_*, where * is the helper name itself. E.g., if you were writing a helper called "specialPurpose", the class name would be "Zend_View_Helper_SpecialPurpose" (note the capitalization). "</p>

<p>This is in clear contridiction of logic and the coding standards; why should custom helpers have Zend as part of the class name. Please let me know what the correct way to do this is and please correct the documentation to make it more consistent.</p>

<p>See:

            <p>Sorry, I broke the number one rule of using a bug tracker -- I didn't search to see if this was already reported. This is a duplicate of ZF-148.</p>
