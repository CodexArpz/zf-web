    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The documentation for Zend_Date that discusses various ISO format codes for Zend_Date (at <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.constants.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a>)  is incorrect for the value it lists for Zend_Date::MILLISECOND. There it lists "A" as being the value for that constant, when in fact the value is "S". This can be verified either by viewing Zend/Date.php or by viewing the API documentation for Zend_Date.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Just as I posted this I realized that the Zend_Date::MILLISECOND constant is listed twice: once at the bottom of the list and once about two-thirds of the way down. The first listing is correct, the second is incorrect. So the last occurrence merely needs to be removed.</p>

            <p>Closing as non-issue.</p>

<p>These 2 constants are not equal.
"S" is the millisecond value... counting of milliseconds independently from time... "10h20min30sec45678ms" where ms stands for the milliseconds which are used by "S".</p>

<p>"A" is the milliseconds value for the given time...
"10h20min30sec" would be converted into milliseconds which would be equal to "37.230.000"</p>

<p>As can be seen a completly different result.</p>

            <p>I understand the difference of meaning of "S" vs. "A" as you describe. Not sure why but now it makes perfect sense to me what the table is indicating, i.e. it isn't saying what values the constants have but (if i would have looked at the heading in that column) what Zend_Date constant best corresponds to a given ISO format code. My apologies for lodging a bogus issue. In any case Zend_Date is a great module. :)</p>
