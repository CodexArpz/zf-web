    <div class="body">
        <p>Since getContent() and getDescription() are two separate high-level methods, it seems to me that former doesn't need to fall back to the latter when it's not available.</p>

<p>Since it is often desirable to check if contents are available, why not simply return false or an empty string? The user can then decide whether or not to fall back to getDescription().</p>

            <p>It's a tricky call for several reasons. The main one, however, is that a lot of feeds still stick their content in a description element (esp. older RSS feeds). Newer feeds are a lot better at sorting out content from descriptions. At a technical level, the content in RSS also uses a third-party namespace (hence its a secondary priority to a description).</p>

<p>Since it remains really useful to make this switch, I won't change it. However, I understand that you may need to differentiate between both and I'd suggest you implement something along the lines of checking if getDescription() == getContent() which should mostly tell you if content is being derived from the description element.</p>
