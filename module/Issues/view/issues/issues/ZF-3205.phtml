    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When using displayGroups, elements used in displayGroups are rendered twice when $form-&gt;render() is called.</p>

<p>If you do not want to render each displayGroup by hand but render the form as a whole, then this goes wrong, because displayGroups only get rendered via FormElements decorator.
So an element gets first rendered in a displayGroup and after that displayGroup is rendered, the element gets rendered on itself. This is no good behaviour.</p>

<p>I suppose that an element is cleared from the form-&gt;_elements array after a displayGroup rendered it. 
As a workaround, I made a displayGroup decorator who only renders displayGroups and no other elements. This applies only to my current situation of course.</p>
