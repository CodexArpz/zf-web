    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>For non English users we need language packs for Zend_Validate we can use.
A infrastructure which allows people to review en commit translations should be placed on the website like with other open source packs.</p>

<p>Otherwise everyone is doing it's own translations. This is a lot of double work!</p>

            <p>Hello, Kristof.</p>

<p>For example, you mean Zend_Filter_Alpha and Zend_Filter_Alnum should be customizable for each languages?</p>

<p>(Zend_Filter_Alpha and Zend_Filter_Alnum  are used in Zend_Validate_Alpha and Zend_Validate_Alnum.)</p>

            <p>There is already a issue for this one...
No need to have it twice.</p>

<p>Still, this issue depends on other like ZF-3164, ZF-4311, ZF-1998, ZF-1877, ZF-4371.
I see this more as part of the this proposal:
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22134">http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/â€¦</a>
even if it's not exactly the same.</p>

<p>Alex:
Would you mind if I take over the work internationalisation, collecting and so on also for this component ?
I see this as part of I18N.
Please give me a reply what you think.</p>

            <p>Closing as fixed.</p>

Acceptance for core has been requested.</p>

            <p>There is still no acceptance.</p>

<p>It could be that it is wished to change the used format or that other points have to be done before migrating it to core.</p>

<p>And we have also to keep the revision where the resouce is build from. Otherwise there would be no way to know which messages have changed and which not.</p>

<p>You could add it, but you must keep track of any changes I am doing within 'en' and 'de' as I will not move other languages to core ( I don't understand them ;-) )</p>
