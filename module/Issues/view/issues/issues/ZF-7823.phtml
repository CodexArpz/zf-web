    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm using Zend_Queue as an emailer through a cron job and would like to be able to set the priority of the message that are being received and sent to the queue. For my specific situation I would want to classify registration validation emails, auction outbid notifications etc as of higher importance then newsletter / comment notifications etc.</p>

<p>I'm sure priority messaging could be utilized in a number of other scenarios as well.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jay</p>

            <p>The adapters don't support this natively.  You'd be better off extending the Db class and modifying the table schema to include a priority column then adjusting the queries to pull back the higher priority messages first.</p>

            <p>That is what I'm currently doing, just wasn't sure if there was a way to add support for it. Not familiar with the other adapters.</p>
