        <p>I do not seem to be able to delete calender events if I have used the ClientLogin authentication method. It does work with AuthSub however. I have tried with my own code and also the demo that was provided.</p>

            <p>I can't find any mention in the Gdata Calendar or Protocol documentation that suggests there is an incompatibility between AuthSub and ClientLogin with respect to delete requests.   I just tried a delete of a calendar entry with both AuthSub and ClientLogin, and I dumped out the Zend_Http_Response object.  But I see that the response is different when using the two authentication methods.</p>

<p>Here's the response when using AuthSub.  This successfully deletes the calendar entry:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
Zend_Http_Response Object
(
    [version:protected] =&gt; 1.1
    [code:protected] =&gt; 200
    [message:protected] =&gt; OK
    [headers:protected] =&gt; Array
        (
            [Cache-control] =&gt; private
            [Content-length] =&gt; 0
            [Date] =&gt; Fri, 12 Jan 2007 18:39:47 GMT
            [Content-type] =&gt; text/html
            [Server] =&gt; GFE/1.3
        )

    [body:protected] =&gt; 
)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what is returned when using ClientLogin.  This does not delete the calendar entry:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

            <p>I have committed a fix in revision 2711 in our subversion repository.  The problem was in a place where the Http Client used by the ClientLogin authentication did not correctly set the 'strictredirects' property, so the redirect of the DELETE was being converted into a GET request.  This returns a status of 200, but of course does not actually delete the calendar entry.</p>

<p>With the fixed code, the CalendarDemo-ClientLogin.php script works, with no modification.  So any PHP code using Zend_Gdata should be able to take advantage of this fix with no code change.</p>
