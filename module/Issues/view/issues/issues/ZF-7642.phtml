    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>If you attempt to use zf:extends as an element with a zf:const included in the value, Zend Framework throws errors.  Currently, if you try to use zf:extends as an element as you can with several of the other non-namespaced tags, Zend Framework will throw the following errors:</p>

<p>Version 1.9.0 (svn: tags/release-1.9.0) of the framework reported:
"A node with a 'const' childnode may not have any other children"</p>

<p>Version 1.9.1 (svn: tags/release-1.9.1) of the framework reported:
"Unknown node with name 'extends' found"</p>

<p>The first error is strange because it almost seems to work, but it detects children in the zf:const tag for some reason when there are none (below example is identical to my attempts and no children are present).  This is true with explicit and self-closing tag arrangements.</p>

<hr /><p>For example, in application.xml, starting with this base:

     ....definitions....

    ....definitions....
</p>

<p>Then trying to extend another definition based on a constant value:

     ....definitions....
</p>

<p>Since there is no way to define a constant in an attribute tag, the only viable options to achieve this are to create a custom loader that appends the constant value in some way when loading sections and creating several custom sections for each custom constant-based environment, creating another segmented file for each constant container, or zf:extends needs to be allowed as an element in Zend_Config_Xml and allowed to contain a zf:const value.  The example may be odd, but it does communicate the issue I'm currently experiencing.</p>

            <p>The error message in 1.9.0 is strange, but it seems to be fixed in 1.9.1, so that is no problem anymore. The second error-message tho is correct, since there is no node "extends" within the zf-namespace. This is in fact a bad example, since you coul have achieved the same effect with a proper configuration-structure.</p>
