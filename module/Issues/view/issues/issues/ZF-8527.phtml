    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The Zend_Mail recipient functions: addTo(), addBcc(), addCc() - each only take a single email address.  Augmenting them to accept an array optionally, and automatically handle the difference between being given a single entry, or an array, will make the functions much more flexible and match how many programmers will want to use them.</p>

            <p>Hello, Eli
Sadly, I do not know the process, is this based on a conclusion argued in #zftalk.dev or Mailing List?</p>

            <p>This was based around me complaining to Matthew about lots of things, <em>grin</em>, including this specific point, when I was writing some code that needed to add multiple emails, that I already had stored in an array.</p>

<p>And most systems would have allowed for some 'bulk add' type functionality, and ZF didn't.</p>

<p>Matthew's response was telling me the typical OSS response of:  "So code it"</p>

<p>And so I did.</p>

            <p>Satoru -- I've actually heard the request a couple of times, and since Eli was willing to code it, it made sense. He ran the design ideas by me first, so I was aware of them.</p>

            <p>Thank You for quick responce, Eli and Matthew.</p>

<p>I feel relieved. :-)
Because I can understand it as a result of requests and agreement by plural people.</p>

<p>Thank you for function improvement and addition of unittest ;-)</p>
