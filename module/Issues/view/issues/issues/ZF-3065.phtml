            <p>Ralph,</p>

<p>I am actually working on this ruleset. Just tell me if it's helpfull for you or not.
I can send you what I've done until yet, but it's far away from being finished because I want to have a complete testbed, and not only the things which we found to be problematic.</p>

<p>For example:
Also how the indention is done (4 spaces) should be tested. I've seen 3 and 2 spaces in the code already. Or how the braket of the if clause is set... it should always be in the same line and not in the next.</p>

            <p>We are not allowed to add a coding standard testbed without writing a proposal even if I was said in past that I don't need it. 
I had to delete my existing work from incubator as wished by the Zend Dev-Team.</p>

<p>Feel free to download the non-finished version from my blog in a few days.</p>

<p>Therefor reassigning this issue to Ralph as he was the main initiator of this work.</p>
