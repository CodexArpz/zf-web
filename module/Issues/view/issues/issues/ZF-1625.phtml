        <p>talawahdotnet writes:</p>

<p>It seems that some subtle documentation errors have crept into the manual in the Table Relationships section of the Zend_Db component.  While some of the individual examples themselves might be correct, when viewed from the perspective of someone reading through the entire DB section of the manual they make things pretty confusing.</p>

<p>The first issue the discrepancy between the example database schema outlined early in the documentation:
(<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.example-database">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>)
and the code examples used in the table relationships section. In the example schema the bugs_products table exists to facilitate the many-to-many relationship between bugs and products. The bugs table itself does not (and
cannot) have a foreign key column that refers to the products table.</p>

<p>However in the first code example in the table relationships section
(<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.relationships.html#zend.db.table.relationships.defining">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>)
the Bugs class has a reference map entry called Products which implies that the bugs database does in fact have a product_id field.  This contradiction is confusing and causes other issues later on.</p>

<p>In the section regarding many to many relationships
(<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.relationships.html#zend.db.table.relationships.fetching.many-to-many">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>)
the example that is given refers to "Bugs" as the intersection table/class when in reality "BugsProducts" should be the intersection table and "Bugs"
is the origin table.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury the block of text that immediately follows the example code breaks down the details for a completely different many-to-many relationship than either the incorrect code that exists or the corrected version that I am suggesting.  That text describes a mapping where "Accounts" is the origin table,  "Bugs" is the intersection table and "Products" is the destination table.  A valid many-to-many mapping, but again, contradictory.</p>

<p>The example code block that follows uses the correct intersection rule but still uses the wrong table:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$productsRowset   = $bug1234-&gt;findManyToManyRowset('Products', 'Bugs', 'Bug');
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$productsRowset   = $bug1234-&gt;findManyToManyRowset('Products', 'BugsProducts', 'Bug');
</code></pre>

<p>The magic method examples do the same.</p>

<p>Finally the Cascading Write Operations section make reference to the mystery product_id field in the bugs table.</p>

<p>Overall I find the documentation for the Zend Framework to be very thorough and clear, it seems like some mistakes just managed to slip though the cracks.  I hope you guys get a chance to look at this before 1.0.  Let me know if you need me to file a bug or something.</p>
