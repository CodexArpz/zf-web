    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There seems to be an issue passing special character values via Zendamf:</p>

<p>While querying a database that returns data including French-text characters (ie: Québec), the result returned from Zendamf is not handling the special characters (ie: instead of Québec, we receive Qu�c).</p>

<p>I've checked the output of the data via Php: the issue is not with the database result - the characters are returned correctly from the database to the Php result-set - I am able to print these characters correctly before they are sent through Zendamf, either by rendering them from Php to a Browser via echo or by writing them to a log file.</p>

<p>However, once I plug the SQL result into an object and pass it to Zendamf, the special characters get mangled.  Using Charles Web Debugging Proxy, I can see that the result values are mangled before they are passed back to my AS3 application.</p>

<p>I've tested this both locally and on a production server, using the most current libraries.  I'm uncertain if there is a setting that would clear-up this issue, please advise, thank you!</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>This is not an issue with Zendamf, but rather Zend_Db, and to resolve the issue I enforced the character set of the persistent db connection to UTF-8 by using the following statement in the Zend_Db::factory parameters:</p>

<p>'driver_options' =&gt; array(PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND =&gt; 'SET NAMES utf8')</p>

<p>This issue can be deleted, thank you!</p>
