    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Uri already provides the ability to parse a given URI into its components as well as check a given string alleged to contain only a URI in order to confirm that it's valid. <a href="http://stephenminded.com/posts/validating-urls-with-zend-framework">This blog post</a> is a good example of where the latter capability is used.</p>

<p>Now see <a href="http://blog.amnuts.com/2009/02/15/shorten-urls-automatically-with-a-zend-framework-filter/">this blog post</a>. This illustrates a related feature that is currently lacking, which is the ability to detect one or more valid URIs within a given string and return a list of them.</p>

<p>As an example, the expression to discern a valid URI is already present for Zend_Uri_Http; the function called just needs to be changed to find all matches within a given string and then return them as an array of Zend_Uri objects of the appropriate class. Potential applications for such a feature include spam analysis on blog post comments, automatically converting URLs to HTML links for display, and checking content for broken (404) links.</p>
