    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This issue was spawned from this forum question: <a href="http://www.nabble.com/confusion-between-resource-plugins-and-resources-in-docs-to24400044.html#a24731301">http://nabble.com/confusion-between-resource-plugiâ€¦</a></p>

<p>The Problem
By reading the ZF Docs for Zend_Controller and Zend_View, the reader is habituated into a more pedantic mode of thought. That is, we learn that the terms to describe objects are very specific.</p>

<ul><li>An 'action controller' is very different to a 'front controller' which is different to a 'controller plugin' which is very different to a 'controller helper'</li>
<li>A 'View' is very different to a 'view helper'</li>
</ul><h2>However, the documentation for Zend Application is written in a slightly less pedantic way:</h2>

<p>Under section "4.3.2. Resource Plugins" 
It says:
"Resources need only implement Zend_Application_Resource_Resource, or, more simply still, extend Zend_Application_Resource_ResourceAbstract. "</p>

<p>Under section "4.4. Examples"
It says:</p>

<h2>"Resource plugins implement Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Resource, which defines simply that they allow injection of the caller and options, and that they have an init() method. "</h2>

<p>Note:
 * that the words 'Resources' and 'Resource plugins' are used interchangeably to mean the same thing.
 * there is a typo in the second paragraph: 'Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Resource' should be 'Zend_Application_Resource_Resource' 
    - (issue ticket for typo already is submitted @ ZF-7416 ).</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Now imagine a newbie  coming to the Zend Framework and reading the documentation on Zend_Application <em>before</em> they read the Zend_Controller (which seems quite likely these days).
Instead they will be habituated to read the docs in a less pedantic way.</p>

<p>So, if there is no consistency in the language used to describe a 'resource plugin' or 'resource' within the Zend_Application docs...it will lead to even more confusion when the reader arrives at Zend_Controller and starts learning about 'controllers' and 'controller plugins'.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Worth being aware of the two issues :
* Typo
* improvement to docs</p>

<p>to make 'find and replace' go smoothly.</p>
