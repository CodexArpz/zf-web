    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>PHPUnit 3.0.0
PHP 5.2.0
Xdebug 2.0.0rc1
Windows XPsp2</p>

<p>Enable Xdebug and invoke phpunit as follows:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
phpunit --verbose --report html Zend_Controller_AllTests
</code></pre>

<p>Observe that the phpunit process take a very long time, utilizes a majority of CPU resources, and the process grows to ~280MB of RAM.</p>

<p>Comment out the following tests:</p>

<ul><li>FrontTest.php: testDispatch2()</li>
<li>FrontTest.php: testDispatch3()</li>
<li>Dispatcher/StandardTest.php: testDispatchValidControllerWithInvalidAction()</li>
</ul><p>Run phpunit again, and observe that the test run completes relatively quickly.</p>

            <p>I'm able to observe that the Dispatcher_StandardTest you indicate takes a long time; the others go very quickly for me. I'll see if I can profile why this is occurring.</p>

            <p>The FrontTest tests do finish a lot more quickly than the testDispatchValidControllerWithInvalidAction() test.</p>

<p>I just ran the tests again and the php.exe process grew to over 600MB in size.  I had to kill the php process.</p>

<p>When I disable Xdebug, the tests complete reasonably promptly, even the Dispatcher/StandardTest suite.  Obviously one wouldn't be running a real website with Xdebug enabled, but I have to run the unit tests regularly to monitor code coverage stats.</p>

            <p>Bill -- the situation gets more and more odd. I've run with the xdebug profiler on both running the tests with the --report switch and without. Both give the same cachegrind output, which shows that that particular test case takes about 0.06% of the overall test time.</p>

<p>When running without the --report switch, the tests run very quickly -- basically the same speed as with xdebug profiling turned off. The only time I experience the delay is with the --report switch turned on, which indicates to me that the issue is with how PHPUnit and XDebug interact when generating the coverage report.</p>

<p>I don't think there's much I can do at this point. I'm attaching the cachegrind output I just generated when running reports for you to look at if so desired.</p>

            <p>Since the issue only crops up when the --report flag is set, a condition that won't happen on production sites, marking as "Won't Fix".</p>
