        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract has a bunch of clearXXX() methods, but unfortunately no clearExceptions().
I've quickly subclassed it to add this method, but it would be nice to have it natively.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a specific error type, that when raised, is catched by error-handler as any other exception, and then error-handler (or any other plugin) redirect to a normal action/controller query. Well on next postDispatch loop event, your response will still be flagged has having an error and will again be handled by your error controller =&gt; recursivity, here we come!</p>

<p>This is just a situation among others were it would be useful. It's just that since a clear method already exists for almost all response properties, it would be nice to have it for exceptions too.</p>

<p>Regards,
Remy</p>
