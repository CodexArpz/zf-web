    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>??compareDate?? method doesn't return date as docs says:</p>

<p>@return Zend_Date  new date</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$valor1 = '28/03/2010 09:45:00';
$valor2 = '03/04/2010 09:45:00';

$fecha_inicio_compare = new Zend_Date($valor1,'es_ES');
$fecha_fin_compare = new Zend_Date($valor2,'es_ES');

$difference = $fecha_fin_compare-&gt;compareDate($fecha_inicio_compare); 

echo $difference;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there isn't a clear example on how to substract dates and obtain days or years for birthday date.</p>

            <p>Closing as non-issue</p>

<p>The manual states:
{quote}
compares $part of $date to this object's timestamp, returning 0 if they are equal, 1 if this object's part was more recent than $date's part, otherwise -1. 
{quote}</p>

<p>As the manual describes Zend_Date's compare() and all subsequent methods are returning integer 0, 1 or -1 like PHP's compare() method.</p>

            <p>This issue has been closed as "non-issue" because you stated that there is a problem within the documentation which was not the case.
There was no patch attached to this issue which has been committed.</p>

<p>There may still be changes to a component when an issue is closed as "non-issue" and something different has been changed but it could be side-related to the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi, are we reading the same?</p>

<p>There is not an "API doc" category in JIRA, only "Documentation" and is an obligatory field. Clearly I wrote "@return Zend_Date new date", indicating this is a trivial issue in PHPDoc.</p>

<p>The "patch" (source changed to r19964) is in the "source" <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8626?page=com.atlassian.jirafisheyeplugin:fisheye-issuepanel">tab</a></p>
