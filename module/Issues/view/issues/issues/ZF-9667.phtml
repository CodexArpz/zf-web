    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This may be more of an improvement than a bug, but ... the ordering of the type constraint checking seems to cause some issues.</p>

<p>For example, if I want the filter to nullify '' and/or array(), I have to allow 0 to be nullified as well, which may not be desired.  This is because if the value is not '' or array(), it will be checked against the 0 int constraint, and if found to be 0, will be nullified.  But what if I didn't want '0' or 0 to be nullified?</p>

<p>Along these lines, if I don't want 0 to be nullified, I have to allow '' and array() to not be nullified.  This is because if the value is '' or array(), it will never be checked as the type constraint will pass those cases (e.g. the type is set to &lt; Zend_Filter_Null::INTEGER).</p>

<p>This seems to be an architectural issue and may also apply to Zend_Validate_NotEmpty and other classes that use a similar approach.  If any fix is pushed, please move Zend_Filter_Null::INTEGER above Zend_Filter_Null::STRING and Zend_Filter_Null::EMPTY_ARRAY in the processing order.</p>

            <p>Not reproducable...</p>

<p>You can do:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
        $filter = new Zend_Filter_Null(
            array(
                Zend_Filter_Null::STRING,
                Zend_Filter_Null::EMPTY_ARRAY
            )
        );
</code></pre>

<p>and will get 0 as 0 returned as also FALSE as FALSE and not as NULL. This is correct and expected behaviour.</p>

<p>Please give a reproducable example for your problem.</p>
