    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In Zend_Gdata_App, for the write operations, redirects are performed manually when Zend_Http_Response::isRedirect() returns true.  In this case, a recursive call to the method in Zend_Gdata_App (put, delete, etc) is made to perform the operation again.</p>

<p>However, this recursive call is being made using the original URL, rather than the URL in the Location header.  This, combined with cookies failing, causes redirects to be performed until Zend_Gdata_App::_maxRedirects is reached (defaults to 5).  AFAIK, this only occurs with Google Calendar, but could occur with other generic APP services which use redirects.</p>

            <p>Resolved in svn revision 5202 - Fixed recursive calls to various HTTP methods (put,delete,etc) in Zend_Gdata_App when redirects are sent by the server. Previously, these recursive calls were being done to the same URL as the original request. This commit resolves that issue to instead perform the subsequent HTTP requests on the URL defined in the Location head  of the response</p>
