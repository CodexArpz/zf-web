    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Section 7.7 of the programmers reference guide (and other places to) provide examples of how to call $this-&gt;view-&gt;render($sciptname) inside an action function in an ActionController.</p>

<p>The most basic examples in there do not work for me. So this is either a bug or the documentation should be updated (or I am terribly mistaken).</p>

<p>Inside myController I want two actions to render the same view.</p>

<p>I have saveAction and editAction.</p>

<p>I want saveAction to render my/save.phtml: no problem, works automatically when using MVC.</p>

<p>I want editAction to render my/save.phtml by calling $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('save'), as the documentation section 7.7 says. It results in an error: script 'save' not found in view/scipts/.</p>

<p>If I write echo $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('my/save.phtml') it works, but as soon as I delete my/edit.phtml from the file system, it starts complaining about not finding 'edit.phtml'.</p>

<p>First: it should be looking in scripts/my and
Second: it should append .phtml. 
It does neither. So either the documentation is outdated and I am the only one that does not know (which is possible). Or the functionality is broken, but then lots of people should be complaining. They are not.</p>

<p>So this will probably come down to me missing something essential, but on the other hand, I have been digging for quite a while now and I can't find an easy solution.</p>

            <p>In this case, I'm sorry to report that you're, to quote your own words, "terribly mistaken."</p>

<p>You're operating on the wrong object, plain and simple: when inside an action controller, you should not call render() on the view object, but rather on the current object:</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$this-&gt;render('save'); // NOT $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('save');
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Because Zend_Controller_Action::render() proxies to the ViewRenderer, which does the view script normalization and lookup for you (adds the suffix and looks for the script in the directory named after the controller); it also does the auto-renderering, so if you call $this-&gt;view-&gt;render(), you're going to get unwanted results (rendered view script AND ViewRenderer will still be trying to render a script based on the current action). Zend_View itself does not have the same functionality, and expects a fully qualified view script.</p>

<p>Look carefully at the documentation -- all examples are operating on the action controller object, and do not utilize the view object. In particular, look at section 7.7.5.</p>

            <p>I'm only glad this was no issue! Readers should note that in the Zend Framework book by Cal Evans, Chapter 5, The View, the misunderstanding is introduced on page 60. I will give him feedback on this.</p>

            <p>On second thought, checking the book for an e-mail address to send my feedback to, I find that you reviewed the book. So maybe you should tell him yourself :).</p>
