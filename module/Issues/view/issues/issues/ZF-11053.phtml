            <p>I actually don't mind the set of two bootstrap files, one in library and one in applications, but they and the phpunit.xml file shouldn't be empty.  Getting their contents automatically set would help new users to start testing, and also provide some consistent testing conventions for everyone.</p>

<p>Should there be two bootstrap files -- and two test suites in phpunit.xml -- one for the application and one for the library code?</p>

            <p>These were created before some PHPUnit usage patterns and features emerged.  Since the PHPUnit's config xml file has bootstrap support now, that is what we use here, that is how this bootstrap will be hooked up.  PHPUnit assumes one bootstrap file per tests/ directory.</p>

<p>These files are being populated with the proper contents, ill have it committed later today-I'll update you what to look for.</p>
