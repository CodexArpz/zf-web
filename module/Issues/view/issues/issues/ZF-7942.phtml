    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>As mentioned in the manual the locale "en_US" should downgrade to "en", if "en_US" not exists, but "en" does. This does not work. I have a language file with "de", but if I set my browser to prefer "de_DE" before "de" the Exception "No translation for language "de_DE" available. I looked into Translate/Adapter.php and found something at line 330</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>        if (empty($this-&gt;_translate[$locale])) {
            if (!$this-&gt;_options['disableNotices']) {
                if ($this-&gt;_options['log']) {
                    $this-&gt;_options['log']-&gt;notice("No translation for the language '{$locale}' available.");
                } else {
                    trigger_error("No translation for the language '{$locale}' available.", E_USER_NOTICE);
                }
            }
        }</code></pre>

<p>If I var_dump() $this-&gt;_translate I see, that there is a key "de_DE" with an empty array as valie, which I have never added. I dont know, where it come from, but its quite annoying.</p>

            <p>I don't see where the problem should be.
According to manual you can disable the triggered notice with the "disableNotices" option.</p>

<p>Or simply look into the codeline you copied...</p>

            <p>The notice itself its not the problem. And of course I see, that I can disable them ;) But where did the "phantom language" data for "de_DE" come from? As I said I never added it. And therefore this notice shouldnt occur here, or what I misunderstood?</p>

            <p>As your issue is about "Language fallback does not work", it has been closed.</p>

<p>What you call "Phantom language" depends on how you initiate Zend_Translate, how your data structure looks like, how you cache, how your locale is detected and some other variants.</p>

<p>It is possible and logical to have phantom languages, for example when you do file search or when you add empty files.</p>

<p>As you did not gave any code or description on how you are using Zend_Translate I see this issue as fixed because code works as expected.</p>
