    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The current inline documentation for Zend_Gdata does a poor job of describing the effects of various classes and method calls, and in a few places is missing entirely. This needs to be improved.</p>

<p>In particular:
* The side effects of various extension elements are not described.
* Limitations and requirements (such as event reminders being limited to what's in the Google Calendar UI) are not described.
* Method descriptions are often terse and don't provide more information than the name of the method they're describing. For example, many setters methods are labeled like this: "Sets the value for this element's FOO property".
* Return values and parameters are not always consistent with what is expected or produced by methods.</p>

<p>While most of the missing information can be figured out by reading the Google Data reference documentation, this shouldn't be a requirement for using this library. Ideally a user should be able to figure out everything about the library solely from the API documentation.</p>
