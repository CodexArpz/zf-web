    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I was working with Zend_Form and I needed to disable the translation for all form's elements.
I tried using Zend_Form::setDisableTranslator but it seems that the propagation do not occur to the elements.
I know I can disable the translation per element, but my first thought about Zend_Form::setDisableTranslator was that it could do the job in a global scope. But checking the source, it not happens.
When an element try to get the translator object, it calls Zend_Form::getDefaultTranslator and in this method no check is made to see if "translatorIsDisabled", but what I get, is the global instance registered in Zend_Registry.</p>

<p>Is there a way where I can globally disable Zend_Form's (and all elements) automatic translation?</p>

<p>If no... it's a good idea, isn't it?
The implementation could be done on Zend_Form::createElement, where Zend_Form_Element::setDisableTranslator will be the same of Zend_Form's value only if this option doesn't exists in the options array.</p>
