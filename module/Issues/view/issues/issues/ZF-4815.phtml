    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Unit tests should be independent. Each test should fully initialize its environment.</p>

<p>Use of classes such as Zend_Auth and Zend_Registry [other examples ???] currently requires the user to use methods such as _unsetInstance() and clearIdentity() in test tearDowns to maintain independence.</p>

<p>This leads to some repetition and (perhaps) could be handled by Zend_Test itself.</p>

<p>(One reservation I have is that such a feature might enforce a particular way of handling such objects and so would need to be well thought through and documented.)</p>

            <p>I see some merit in this idea, but it has always been the responsibility of the test writer to guarantee test isolation. It seems that if Zend_Test were to do it for you, there would have to be pretty strict conventions on where stuff is put, like everything goes in the registry. This isn't really the ZF way.
Matthew, can you evaluate and close the issue if you agree?</p>

            <p>Perhaps all is needed here is a <em>guide</em> to the components that are likely to need resetting and an example of how it's done. (Rather than more code per se.) This could be used as a checklist/cheatsheet when writing tests.</p>

<p>If this is the way to go, I would be happy to write up the guide if, say, Matthew could 1) check that the list of components I came up with was complete (enough) and 2) cast an editorial eye over the final product. Hopefully this would be less work than Matthew just writing it himself :-)</p>
