    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Should have a Zend_Validate_File validator with basics tests (file exists, file is readable) and others ZVF components should extend this validator as it would permit not to have differents error messages for the same usage (for example : fileMd5NotFound, fileHashNotFound, fileFilesSizeNotReadable, fileExistsDoesNotExist, fileCrc32NotFound, etc.)
It's boring for translation !</p>

            <p>Just because you are bored this is no reason to change an existing implementation and integrate a BC break.</p>

            <p>You're right it's not a good reason... but in fact I don't think that duplication of code can be a good thing and I think that it is also a logical and a coherence problem.
When I was younger I learned stupid basics things in alogrithmic (don't duplicate code, keep coherence, only one exit point in a function, etc.).. Those academics things are just still hanting me.
It's only a personal opinion, up to you do decide or not to do something.</p>

            <p>I am not against such a change, and I am pedantic myself.</p>

<p>But this is a BC break and BC breaks are not allowed to be integrated until 2.0 when the dev-team does not decide it to be necessarily integrated before 2.0.</p>

            <p>You're right.
It's not a priority and creating a BC break now for this shouldn't be a good idea...</p>

            <p>Closing as wont fix.</p>

<p>With the actual release resource files are available which provide pre-translated content for all validators.</p>

<p>Additionally for translation the content instead of the key can be used.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that for own implementations users could be in need of own independend translations for these validator keys.</p>
