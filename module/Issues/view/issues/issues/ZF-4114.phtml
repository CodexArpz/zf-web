    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I was wondering if it could be possible to change all private methods defined in Zend_Translate_Adapter_Xliff into protected ones?</p>

<p>I wanted to create a subclass with small changes to fit my purposes (basically use own defined ids as array keys for $this-&gt;_translate instead of source strings), which could have been easily done overloading -&gt;_startElement() method which unfortunately is defined as private.</p>

<p>For now I've copy-pasted the code into a new class and made my changes there, but by doing this it won't benefit further improvements from Zend_Framework updates. It would be really great.</p>

<p>Thanks for the job anyway!</p>

<p>Regards,
Remy</p>

            <p>Changing the ID brakes translation.</p>

<p>The adapter classes are not allowed to be extended because of the risk of information loss. This would lead to severe problems with the base class.</p>

<p>The only way is to create a own adapter and use this as base for translations.</p>

<p>If there are problems with the actual implementation please add a issue.
If you see enhancements please also add a issue as probably also other adapters may benefit from it.</p>
