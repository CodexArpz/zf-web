<p>Don't know, if it is supported by the current Zend_Config_Xml implementation, needs to be checked. For INI, it should also be called include, and not import.</p>

            <p>I'm carrying this out.</p>

<p>But before going further, I'd like to dicuss a bit the approach.</p>

<p>I'm not fond of the ':' operator since it's already used by default as inheritance operator. I would suggest something like:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
[production]
phpSettings.display_errors = false

; inserts the content of subset/common.ini 
; just like if it were typed directly here
@include subset/common.ini

; imports all ini files from the resources.d sub-directory 
; using their name (without extension) as key
resources = @import ressources.d/*.ini

</code></pre>

<p>with other files in ressources.d/ looking like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
; as it is imported from a "db".ini file, these keys
; will be treated as db.*
adapter = "pdo_mysql"
params.host = "localhost"
</code></pre>

<p>this approach aims at mimicking apache2.conf and php.ini ones.</p>

<p>it allows to separate whole parts of the configuration.</p>

<p>What do you think about this?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>To use "@" instead of ":" it's ok for me ;)</p>

<p>Your part to include multiple files by wild-cards is an interesting idea and I have the following questions/issues to this:
1. It will be only supported by ini-files or is there an xinclude port of it?</p>

<ol><li><p>Which wild-cards should be available?
-&gt; Only *, ?
-&gt; Or usage of glob or fnmatch</p></li>
<li><p>resources = @import ressources.d/<em>.ini
-&gt; There is no way to create an real option value "@include foobar"
Why not using (Don't tested it yet):
resources@import = ressources.d/</em>.ini
or resources.@import = ressources.d/*.ini</p></li>
</ol><p>Additional: Is the a chance to import config files of different types ?
like @include subset/common.xml</p>

  <ol><li><p>It will be only supported by ini-files or is there an xinclude port of it?
  To be honest I'm not a big fan of XML, and don't it that well - so I would say that if such an implementation exists, well, we can manage to support it :)</p></li>
  <li><p>Which wild-cards should be available?
  -&gt; Only *, ?
  -&gt; Or usage of glob or fnmatch
  I feel like glob would do the trick - if I don't use it, I'll be forced to use/emulate regexp, which probably wouldn't be more efficient. So glob is a good candidate for me.</p></li>
  <li><p>resources = @import ressources.d/<em>.ini
  -&gt; There is no way to create an real option value "@include foobar"
  Why not using (Don't tested it yet):
  resources@import = ressources.d/</em>.ini
  or resources.@import = ressources.d/*.ini
  I didn't test neither yet, but I feel like it would be easier and more efficient not to parse the key part of the file. Using key = hard_coded_value / @import/include/something_else would be easier to handle. I wouldn't implement something to complicated if it's not to serve the usability of the component</p></li>
  </ol><p>Additional: Is the a chance to import config files of different types ?
  like @include subset/common.xml
  I guess it would be, but I think this would make harder to implement a caching mechanism, and overall, would be confusing to me :)</p>

  Thanks a lot for your comment and suggestions!</p>

<p>well, I didn't have much time to work on it recently unfortunately...</p>

<p>It was more a case of if you have code then it would be good to get a prototype and see if we could get it completed for ZF2.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>well, I've got some good news... I worked a bit on my code today, and I managed to get something working. The bad news are that it's limited to .ini files (or ini formatted files to be more accurate), and does not support Zend_Config_Writer neither.</p>

<p>But his does the trick:</p>

<p>main.ini</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
[production]
key = "key value"
@include = "conf.d/*.ini"

[development]
devKey = "test"
</code></pre>

<p>conf.d/db.ini</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
[production]
db.adapter = "mysql"
db.param.host = "localhost"

[development]
db.adapter = "dev db adapter"
</code></pre>

<p>conf.d/phpSettigns.ini</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
[production]
phpSettings.display_errors = off
</code></pre>

<p>results in this array (generated by -&gt;toArray() on the Zend_Config_Ini("main.ini", "production") object) :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
array(3) {
  ["key"] =&gt; string(9) "key value"
  ["db"] =&gt; array(2) {
    ["adapter"] =&gt; string(5) "mysql"
    ["param"] =&gt; array(1) {
      ["host"] =&gt; string(9) "localhost"
    }
  }
  ["phpSettings"] =&gt; array(1) {
    ["display_errors"] =&gt; string(0) ""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works with one section or more, and also with no section at all. I tested it many ways, but only manually yet. I still have to write unit tests for it. But has it mostly does... nothing but instantiating new Zend_Config_Ini objects, it shouldn't need that many tests.. Moreover, by having add a "_fileName" property, and thus creating an object for every file, it shouldn't be that difficult to add writing support...</p>

<p>What do you think about it (patch against latest svn version and full class file attached)?</p>

            <p>I 'm disagreed  with the way to process here. The ability to Imports a file is a good feature/idea but it sound like a big improvement and code remaniement. Also, any improvement like this must be ported in all adapters (eg. yaml, xml and so on) to be able to provide a common specification. BTW: I've your looked at the Symfony 2 to take idea for the way to process ?</p>
