    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Environment: Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mssql connecting to Microsoft SQL Server 2008</p>

<p>To reproduce:</p>

<p>Create a table in a schema other than dbo, e.g. a schema called "audit", table called e.g. "EventHistory".
Invoke Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mssql::describeTable('EventHistory', null);</p>

<p>Look at the PRIMARY field of the primary key column, which will be false. This is because sp_pkeys with a null argument for @table_owner (schema name) works for tables in the 'dbo' schema, but returns 0 primary keys for tables in non-dbo schemas.</p>

<p>Use case:</p>

<p>My application uses $db-&gt;listTables() to get a list of all tables, then uses Zend_Db_Table instances created from this list to operate on each table. A few tables in my database are in schemas other than 'dbo', e.g. schemas 'audit' and 'cache'.</p>

<p>listTables() lists these tables, but as it doesn't include the schema name I cannot pass this to the Zend_Db_Table constructor. (Schema name is marked optional everywhere including on describeTable() so there should be no problem - unless the same table name appears twice.)</p>

<p>Functions acting on tables not in the dbo schema that rely on the primary key, will fail with the message "A table must have a primary key, but none was found."</p>

<p>As a workaround I am extending listTables() to qualify tables in non-dbo schemas with the schema name as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Returns a list of the tables in the database.
 * Overrides the Zend implementation to add schema prefix for tables not in the dbo schema.
 * @return array
 */
public function listTables()
{
    // Shipped impl: $sql = "SELECT name FROM sysobjects WHERE type = 'U' ORDER BY name";
    // New impl:
    $sql = "SELECT case when s.name is null or s.name = 'dbo' then o.name else s.name+'.'+o.name end as name"
    ." from sysobjects o left join sys.schemas s on o.[uid] = s.[schema_id]"
    ." where o.type = 'U' order by name";
    return $this-&gt;fetchCol($sql);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can then pass the schema name if present on to Zend_Db_Table, avoiding this issue.</p>

<p>I could also hack Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mssql to query for the schema name if schema name is null before calling sp_pkeys so that the sp_pkeys call returns correct results. That is probably a better solution (one that doesn't change the contract of listTables()). I don't want to change Zend classes so I am reporting this bug and using the former workaround for now.</p>

            <p>I would recommend using the sqlsrv adapter instead of pdo_mssql; the latter is very much out-dated at this time.</p>

            <p>sqlsrv doesn't support connecting to SQL Server from Linux, it is only an option for those running PHP on Windows.</p>

<p>My ZF-based software system runs on Linux and it connects to heterogenous databases within the organisation (PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL and Sybase).</p>

<p>If I provide a patch or snippet will that help?</p>
