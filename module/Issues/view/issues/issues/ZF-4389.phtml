    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, it is not directly possible through Zend_Config, to update the config files from which a configuration was loaded. I would suggest to add a ``` is true). Hence it is not really possible to preserve the config format the user used (e.g. intendation, use of attributes in Zend_Config_Xml), the save() method would just write the data in a generic given format.</p>

<p>The question would be, what about sections? When section A extends section B, Zend_Config doesn't know about the sections anymore after loading the config, and also not, in which section to write new data. This is a problem which I couldn't solve yet (in my opinion, a writable config file does not require sections, as it is a config file which is dynamically updated at runtime, and thus doesn't depend on enviroments).</p>

<p>Any comments?</p>

            <p>See ZF-2838.</p>

<p>I'd prefer to see the ability to write out configuration files in a separate class (Zend_Config_Writer maybe?) for two reasons:
1. Zend_Config doesn't need the bloat.
2. It's a non-trivial problem that doesn't map exactly to reading the config file.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Agreed, as discussed in IRC, I'm going to create a proprosal for an appropriate Writer interface.</p>
