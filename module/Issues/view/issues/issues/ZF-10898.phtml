    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>PHPUnit allows the ability to load a phpunit.xml.dist file in place of the phpunit.xml file if the phpunit.xml file does not exist.
<a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/textui.html">http://phpunit.de/manual/current/â€¦</a></p>

<p>In keeping with that convention, my applications ship with an application.xml.dist or application.ini.dist. Unfortunately, when Zend_Application#_loadConfig() is given a string of "application.ini.dist", the "dist" is the only part of the suffix evaluated...the .ini part is ignored. This causes an exception:</p>

<p>Zend_Application_Exception('Invalid configuration file provided; unknown config type');</p>

<p>I propose a patch to honor *.dist files and if accepted, I'd like to push it through.</p>

            <p>For the record, I'm against this "functionality". The reason for this is that phpunit is shipped with a basic configuration file to run a vanilla setup. Since with ZF it's mandatory to write your own config file, there's no reason why you wouldn't call it application.ini (or whatever) right-away yourself.</p>

            <p>@Dolf: a prime use case for having a ".dist" file is for version control purposes. The basic settings intended for production are put in that file, and checked in; individual developers copy this to "application.ini", and make changes specific to their own environment -- and exclude the "application.ini" file from versioning by their VCS. It's a very sane practice, and one we've been using with the ZF site for some years.</p>

<p>Wil, I think we should move forward on this.</p>

            <p>Wil, in what revisions did you implement this? I think it's breaking my application...</p>

<p>Since this is new functionality and not a bug, I also fail to see why it was implemented in a mini version. Sorry if I'm a gamespoiler here 8)</p>

            <p>Dolf,</p>

<p>It was implemented into 1.11.5.</p>

<p><em>I also fail to see why it was implemented in a mini version. Sorry if I'm a gamespoiler here</em></p>

<p>No worries. Valid point. I saw it as a minor enhancement rather than a new feature, but I suppose it could be interpreted differently.</p>

<p><em>I think it's breaking my application</em></p>

<p>That's not good. Can you tell me what issue(s) you are having with this so I can check it out? Thanks.</p>
