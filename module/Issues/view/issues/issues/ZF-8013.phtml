    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Nested layouts in Zend_Layout would be really useful. Sometimes you have a page that's split in multiple larger segments, where you would need several layouts, to get it right.</p>

<p>I've recently needed it in a project, and i didn't come up with a nice solution using helpers/actions etc.</p>

<p>It's also useful if you just want your current view wrapped in some plain HTML.</p>

<p>I've looked elsewhere, and Symfony templating has this feature, implemented really well, and simple. <a href="http://components.symfony-project.org/templating/trunk/book/02-Templating">http://components.symfony-project.org/templating/â€¦</a> (Under "Inheritance"). I believe django has this as well, with their templating solution, and ZF would benefit from it as well.</p>

<p>Usage is something like:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

&lt;?php $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;extend('wrapper') ?&gt;

This is my view wrapped by a layout.
</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre><div class="wrapper"><code>
    &lt;?= $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;content ?&gt;
</code></div><code>
</code>

<p>Expected result</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre><div class="wrapper"><code>
    This is my view wrapped by a layout.
</code></div><code>
</code>

<p>I've attached a really simple patch that implements the functionality. It's basically just the same strategy as the symfony templating solution uses, and in my view it fits quite nicely with Zend_Layout, and actually i'm a bit surprised this hasn't been thought of before. Unless i'm missing some proper way of doing this.</p>

<p>My patch - (Basically a port of symfonys strategy) can be found here: <a href="http://gist.github.com/201465">http://gist.github.com/201465</a></p>

<p>I couldn't find anything in the license that prevents this from going into ZF but maybe i'm wrong. According to the templating web-page, it's released under the MIT license.</p>

<p>Raw version is attached.</p>

            <p>This issue might also enable a good solution to the problem with Dojo widgets being created after the <em>echo $this-&gt;dojo();</em>, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3829609/zend-dojo-form-in-a-layout">Stackoverflow zend-dojo-form-in-a-layout</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2869435/zend-dojo-form-not-rendering-in-layout">Stackoverflow zend-dojo-form-not-rendering-in-layout</a> that have problems when they can't nest a layout containing all the Dojo code into the main layout. I've also <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7194">asked the docs</a> to be clarify on this point. Adding this functionality would probably be the most elegant way for getting Dojo widgets into the layout.</p>
