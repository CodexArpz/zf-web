            <p>I just found out that the SVN manual was already updated. However, the usage is still unclear.
I understand that now, I only need one line to use all languages.</p>

<p>For example $translate = new Zend_Translate('tmx', 'path/to/mytranslation.tmx', 'en'); will enable english but also all other languages declared in the tmx file. Is this correct?</p>

<p>If so, how do I access the other languages. If I use $translate-&gt;setLocale('fr'); without setting the additionnal language, I get the following exception:
Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Translate_Exception' with message 'Language (fr) has to be added before it can be used.</p>

<p>With the current documentation, it is unclear for me if I am doing something wrong or if there is an issue.</p>

            <p>If the issue is still there with the latest SVN release feel free to add a new issue / reopen this one.
This helps us not to look for hours and then recognise that the issue is already fixed ;-)</p>

<p>It always helps us if people give additional informations as php version and svn release :-)</p>
