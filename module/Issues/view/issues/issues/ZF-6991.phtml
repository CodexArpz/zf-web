    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Gdata_Extension_Reminder::__toString() has multiple issues:</p>

<ol><li>Using local variable instead of $this-&gt;, thus never yielding the desired output.</li>
<li>Not having spaces around the strings, thus if it would yield output, it wouldn't be properly readable.</li>
<li>$s; is not declared - first line should be (something along the lines of...) $s = '';</li>
<li>Not 100% sure on this one - but as far as I understand this class and associated GData API, it can have either an absolute time, or a set of Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds set. Therefor, it should not use elseif-statements, since a reminder can be in 3 hours AND 12 minutes.</li>
</ol><p>In short... it's not very pretty - and makes me wonder if anyone actually ever __toString'd this class.</p>

            <p>__toString() method fixed.  According to Gdata docs you have to choose between absolute time, days, minutes or hours so I left the switch statement.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the fix, Michael. Looks good.</p>

<p>I'm reopening this, because this point still needs to be addressed:</p>

<p>bq. 4. Not 100% sure on this one - but as far as I understand this class and associated GData API, it can have either an absolute time, or a set of Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds set. Therefor, it should not use elseif-statements, since a reminder can be in 3 hours AND 12 minutes.</p>

<p>That should be simple, I'll go ahead and fix that.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I looked into the GData API and found that Michael is right. The GData API only handles values consisting of one type, and suggests converting them to the smallest type required - so 2 days, 17 hours should be converted into (2x24 + 17) hours.</p>

<p>However, when displaying (which I presume what the __toString() is intended for?), it would definitely be nicer to have the conversion into separate units so fixing it does seem to be the way to go.</p>

<p>As a suggestion, when you're working on it: you might want to refactor this functionality into a separate public method, returning an array of units. Then use that to build up the string.</p>

            <p>Further info:</p>

<p>The limitation mentioned above is actually part of their description of the PHP API:  <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_php.html#Reminders">http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/…</a> - this creates a bit of a chicken/egg problem. Fix the behaviour to be more flexible or stay compatible with the official docs?</p>

<p>Internally, the Gdata protocol always uses minutes, based on <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#Reminders">http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/…</a></p>
