    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>File: /Zend/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php
Line: 207</p>

<p>In the smtp transport the from address is set with the following function:</p>

<p>// Set sender email address
$this-&gt;_connection-&gt;mail($this-&gt;_mail-&gt;getFrom());</p>

<p>When sending a mail to an unknown user with a valid host. In most cased the headers will be read and the Return-Path header will be used to return the mail.</p>

<p>When sending a mail to a non-existing host. The smtp server will return the mail to the from address given in the smpt transport. The header has not been read.</p>

<p>In my opinion the sender email address must be set with the following function, so the bounce addresses goes to the return path.</p>

<p>// Set sender email address
$this-&gt;_connection-&gt;mail($this-&gt;_mail-&gt;getReturnPath());</p>

<p>Which automatically fallback in the from address if return path is not set.</p>

            <p>Funny that this was created yesterday. I recently had the same problem on a project I am working on. This should really be as simple as changing the function that is called. Hope that this fix can be included in the next mini release.</p>

            <p>I saw the issue ZF-7008 but that one is using the php mail function:</p>

<p>"Sending mail with an additional command line parameter."</p>

<p>In my case i use the SMTP transport.</p>

<p>$transport = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp('mail.example.com');</p>

<p>Because of that, i cannot use the function described in zend manual:</p>

<p>$transport = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Sendmail('-freturn_to_me@example.com');</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I also agree that the MAIL FROM should be able to be overridable (either as a transport option or by interpretting the $mail-&gt;getReturnPath).</p>

<p>This is commonly used to forward bounces to another email address for processing, whilst allowing manually replied messages go back to the From address.</p>

<p>The Reply-To header isn't an option in these cases, as the bounce address might have additional information such as user id to be used to identify the non-existant email address for automatic unsubscription, and unnessary for the receiver to see the information (which clients seeing Reply-To, will also display the From).</p>

<p>Since sendmail supports setting this return path, please can the smtp class?</p>

            <p>Please read <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt</a> regarding Return-Path</p>

<h1>ZF-195 originally added this feature</h1>

<h1>ZF-8273 was incorrect, it was not a bug, and was what broke #ZF-195 and caused this issue.</h1>

<p>The Return-Path is what is set in transit by the MAIL FROM, and any Return-Path header sent to Smtp is stripped. The From mail header gives the user the friendly reply address even when MAIL FROM is different.</p>

            <p>To clarify, I believe this is a regression bug caused by ZF-8273 breaking Smtp Return-Path support, affecting ZF 1.9.6 onwards. (edited to correct version number)</p>

<p>Here is a patch to fix it.</p>

            <p>I was asked on irc to include a unit test for this, so I've added a test to the SmtpTest, and included a mock SMTP protocol class needed for it, which fails before the patch and succeeds after.</p>

            <p>Agreed, the behavior introduced by ZF-8273 is incorrect.  The RFC 2821 states that both the MAIL FROM and the Return-Path header should be the same value:</p>

<pre class="literal">
The first step in the procedure is the MAIL command.

      MAIL FROM: [SP  ] </pre>

<p>... and ...</p>

<pre class="literal">
 The time stamp line and the return path line are formally defined as
   follows:

Return-path-line = "Return-Path:" FWS Reverse-path </pre>

<p>Andy, there are a couple of problems with your proposed patch.  It doesn't run unless the TESTS_ZEND_MAIL_SMTP_ENABLED constant is set to true, which isn't necessary because this can be tested offline.  Also the calls to addBcc(), addCc(), etc, aren't necessary to test this.</p>

<p>So, I'm attaching a simplified patch which includes a test that runs by default.</p>
