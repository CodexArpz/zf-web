    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm using partialLoop with array that originates from MongoDB, so its structure is as follows:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$model = array(
    0 =&gt; array('_id' =&gt; '4e9d6f2dd434488c1baf024a', 'otherKey' =&gt; 'otherData'),
    1 =&gt; array('_id' =&gt; '4e9d6f2dd434488c1baf0246', 'key' =&gt; 'data'), // And so on
);
</code></pre>

<p>When I call</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$this-&gt;partialLoop('mypartial.phtml, $model);
</code></pre>

<p>I get an exception

Zend_View_Exception: Setting private or protected class members is not allowed in /library/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 815

I found out that this is because of underscores in array keys (i.e. keys '_id' which are natural for MongoDB data). I also tried it with other keys with underscores (just to make sure '_id' doesn't conflict with some inherited field or something), like '_dummyKey', and it didn't work either. Perhaps this issue is not very serious, but it makes working with MongoDB data quite tedious.</p>

            <p>This is especially annoying given the fact that you can't opt to not return the _id field in a Mongo query, so the only solution is to loop over the result and unset this field. Tedious indeed!</p>

            <p>Seconding this issue. It is quite frustrating (although work aroundable), particularly for someone brand new to working with ZF.</p>

<p>There are 3 solutions I can think of to get the correct behaviour.
1) Use Reflection to check if the variable is indeed private/protected (ignore the _ prefix)  (may have some performance impact, will still object to actual conflicts between user variables and private/protected variables).</p>

<p>2) use Magic Getter/Setter functions to move user supplied variables to a seperate name space (e.g. array etc) (no idea what the impact of this would be)</p>

<p>3) prevent direct assignment ($view-&gt;var) require use of $view-&gt;assign(), and set user variables into an array or simmilar for retreival with another function. (this will break a lot of peoples scripts).</p>
