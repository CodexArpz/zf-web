    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Quite easy to reproduce:</p>

<p>Create two identical files, test1.php, test2.php, that contain the same following code:</p>

&lt;?php
    $fp = fopen("foo.txt", "w");
    if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)) {
        print "Got lock!\n";
        sleep(20);
        fclose($fp);
    }
    else {
      echo "NO LUCK";
    }
?&gt;

<p>Now, open 5 tabs in your browser, and run 5 times test1.php. While they all load, try to run test2.php a few times.
Behaviour on my server:</p>

<p>The 5 test1.php runs will finish after respectively 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 seconds (approximatively, server configured with no php timeout). So it seems that the flock is working in blocking mode, although it shouldnt as it has LOCK_NB set. However, during all the time the 5 test.php load, test2.php will never be able to get the lock and will end directly with "No Luck" - so the same script will work properly (in non blocking mode) if run under a different name.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you can reproduce :) It is for a cronjob that will run every minute - and if te script takes more than a minute to do its job, I will end up with a thousands processes waiting for the lock to be released...</p>

<p>Am running Ubuntu 8.04 with Zend PHP installed from Zend repos (using with KnowledgeTree). A bit unsure how to get the exact version, let me know how I can provide more details! Thanks</p>
