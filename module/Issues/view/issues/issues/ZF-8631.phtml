    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In the Reference Guide, many examples demonstrate instantiating an instance of Zend_File_Transfer. In reality, the class constructor contains code to throw an Exception with the message "Implementation in progress" if it is directly instantiated. Presumably, only adapters can be instantiated off the bat.</p>

            <p>A few thoughts on this issue that I've observed:</p>

<ol><li>Since Zend_File_Transfer is not yet fully implemented, it should be moved to the incubator for development.</li>
<li>The existing documentation should state very clearly, and in an unambiguous manner, that this functionality is still under development. - *** edit: My apologies, I just found the documentation that clearly states ZFT is not yet ready. :)</li>
<li>The exception message in the constructor should be more clear and avoid using the word "progress". My first suggestion would be, "Zend_File_Transfer is not fully implemented at this time." </li>
</ol><p>I will be more than happy to help contribute to this class and will be following up on as many tickets as I can. :)</p>

            <p>The first probably can't happen - it's a released component so removing it now would be a backwards compatibility issue. I think the docs could be updated and it'd be fine. Not all components can be finished on the spot so there's always leeway for completion and improvements after a release.</p>
