    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>PHP has a PECL module called <a href="">www.php.net/manual/en/book.ssh2.php</a>" rel="nofollow"&gt;SSH2. Unfortunatly, not everyone is able to install anything with their share hosting. ZF has already many very good  / better implementations of some PECL modules and even PHP functions (ex: Http client, JSON codec, etc.) and one that could be beneficial to some users would be some way to connect through SSH directly with PHP.</p>

<p>I am proposing this feature when I came across <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/package/2477-PHP-SSH-client-implementation-in-pure-PHP.html">this class</a>. The code needs to be refactor (if ever used as base class), but the theory of application is there (and functional)</p>

<p>The (base) interface could look something like :</p>

<pre class="literal">
Zend_Ssh_Client {
   +__construct($options:array)
   +connect():boolean  (@throws Zend_Ssh_Client_Exception)
   +disconnect():boolean
   +execute($cmd:string):string  (@throws Zend_Ssh_Client_Exception)
   +getPassword():string
   +getUser():string
   +isConnected():boolean
   +setPassword($pass:string):Zend_Ssh_Client
   +setUser($user:string):Zend_Ssh_Client
}
</pre>

<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>A couple notes:
* Zend_Json was created because, at the time, ext/json was not included by default in PHP, and we wanted an implementation that developers could drop-in. Since then, it has continued for backwards compatibility purposes, but also because it adds several features ext/json does not have (such as encoding of JavaScript literals, ability to use different charsets, and choices as to how objects are encoded/decoded).
* Zend_Http predates ext/http. ext/http is still not included in default PHP installs, though that may change in upcoming releases. ZF's HTTP client offers some benefits over the extension: ability to mock requests, ability to use different adapters (in fact, ext/http would be a good additional adapter for us to utilize), etc.</p>

<p>My thought is that for us to include an SSH implementation, it would need to offer benefits above and beyond the PECL extension, and it would need to be functionality that a number of developers are requiring for their projects (and for which ext/ssh2 is not an option). Regardless, the appropriate place to request new components is via a proposal in the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home">wiki</a>.</p>

            <p>I understand the need for proposal, however since I'm not sending actual code, and proposing needs me to sing the CLA agreement... I donwloaded the PDF a while ago, but didn't get around to actually print it out and send it due to the infrequent need to actually submit any code at the moment. But I'm going off topic here.</p>

<p>Why would this package be beneficial? You said that Zend_Json was originally created because PHP didn't include ext/json by default and this is certainly the case with SSH2. Zend_Ssh_Client_Adapter could also be a wrapper around ext/ssh (ext/ssh2) if it eventually comes out included with PHP.</p>

<p>Perhaps the package is not properly labelled; it could be named Zend_Shell_Client and have Zend_Shell_Client_Adapter_SshAdapter and Zend_Shell_Client_Adapter_ShAdapter (or BashAdapter), etc. There could even be a Zend_Shell_Command class as a helper to build commands to be sent to the Zend_Shell_Client instance.</p>

<p>Just a thought...</p>

            <p>The main points I was trying to make are:</p>

<ul><li>Both Zend_Json and Zend_Http offer benefits over the PECL extensions, which makes for a much more convincing reason to keep them in ZF than if they simply wrapped or duplicated the functionality.</li>
<li>If you want to see the functionality in ZF, you either need to contribute it, or gather enthusiasm amongst other contributors for the component such that they may be willing to code the contribution. My team doesn't have the time to do new components unless they are related to core infrastructure or initiatives.</li>

            <p>Fair enough. Though I didn't know it would be assign to your team specifically (or any other as a matter of fact.) I shall see what I can do and come up with an abstraction layer for a Zend_Shell package that would include both local and secure shell clients, sign the CLA, submit it via the wiki and see what people think of it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>The class the OP links to is SSH-1 only and, looking at the comments in the support forum, has long since been abandoned.  phpseclib, in contrast, supports SSH-1 and SSH-2 and is actively maintained:</p>

<p><a href="http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/">http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>It's also a lot more feature packed.  Supports not only password authentication but also keyboard-interactive and publickey.  And it has practically no dependencies.  The one mentioned in the OP requires bcmath and mcrypt - phpseclib requires nothing.  It'll use bcmath (or gmp) and mcrypt if they're available but has fallback implementations if they're not.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think all of phpseclib ought to be integrated into the Zend framework.</p>
