<p>When will these functions be documented in the docblock?  (including the effect of using or not using $gmt, $locale, one of the two, or both of these two)</p>

            <p>Actualy I've reworked from 1 - 2989....</p>

<p>So please be patient.
Reworking all docblocks takes some time.</p>

<p>With docblocks the other functions are also reworked to act as expected.</p>

<p>$gmt should only be suppressed for formats which are GMT related (timestamp for example).
$locale should never be supressed until now. But reworking is not finished.</p>

            <p>With 0.7 scheduled for release on January 17th, and basic API incomplete (including docblock explanations of intended usage of input arguments), it is difficult for me to help more.  I greatly appreciate the difficulty and effort you are making in reworking the docblocks, API code, unit tests, and bug fixes :)</p>

<p>I don't understand what is meant by "suppressed".
Could you describe in detail:
* when $gmt can be used, when it should not be used, and what is the intended/expected effect of using/not using it
* when $locale can be used, when it should not be used, and what is the intended/expected effort of using/not using it</p>

<p>If the answers are repetitive for many API functions, then we can factor the answers to a common location, and then refer to it within the docblocks -e.g. $gmt .. same as for method foo().</p>

<p>It looks to me like some methods permit simultaneous use of $gmt and $locale, but others do not permit simultaneous use.</p>

            <p>The GMT issue is not as easy as it seems...</p>

<p>The getXXX functions use GMT for outputting GMT time or non GMT time (Europe/Berlin, America/Denver,...)
10.Jan.2000 10:04:00... internally always the GMT/UTC time is stored.
So GET's default is FALSE.</p>

<p>addXXX functions use GMT for correcting input is necessary.
addHour (5); will expect the time to be given GMT, as 5 hours should be added... but if a date object is given it could also be that someone wants to substract the non GMT hour from date.</p>

<p>All xxxtimestamp functions will not accept $gmt as timestamp is always GMT.
$locale is then only needed if a other locale has to be set to the new date object.</p>

<p>The intendend effect is always the default behavior.
If you have a localized date like "10.April.2000 10:00:00" we can not detect if it's gmt or not.</p>

<p>Standard user behavior will be not to use GMT.
Standard user behavior will be not to use LOCALE as he set's it on date object creation.
Only if he wants to have a date object for another location / country / locale or if he has to work with a date/datepart of foreign localization he has to set it.</p>

<p>In general I mean with "suppressed" that there is no way to use it... like timestamps for example. They are always GMT. So gmt was not included (or deleted later by reworking).</p>

<p>And for simultaneousity:
All XXXYYY functions work the same...
getHour, getYear, getMinute, getDate have always the same behavior
addHour, addSecond, addTime also and so on...</p>

<p>These are only functions for simplifying user behavior... not to know the constants for often used functions or automatic detection like months.</p>

            <p>Fixed with SVN 2633.</p>

<p>All functions are reworked and use the GMT as expected.</p>
