    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I spotted a few spelling mistakes and typos in the Zend_Translate documentation. I don't know if they are as frequent on other docs, since I haven't thoroughly read the others in a while, but it might be good to have some technical writer peruse the doc and proofread it... :)</p>

<p>Below Example 37.6, "different adapters with a description of their useage:" and under the note for 37.3.8., "The useage is quite the same as initiating a single translation" :
---&gt; "Useage" should be "usage".</p>

<p>"37.3.7. Handling languages</p>

<p>When working with different languages there are a few methods which will be usefull. "
---&gt; "usefull" should be "useful". Also found under 37.3.10.</p>

<p>"37.3.8.2. Language through filenames</p>

<p>Another way to detect the langage automatically is to use special filenames. You can eighter name the complete file or parts of a file with the used language."
---&gt; "Eighter" should be "either".</p>

<p>---&gt; Also, the word "available" is spelled as "avaiable" several times over (do a ctrl + f with the "highlight all" in Firefox), including in the code example 37.7.</p>

<p>Below Example 37.9, "But Zend_Translate will ignore all files which are no sources or which produce failures while reading the translation data. So you have to get sure that all of your translation sources are correct and readable because you will not get any failure if a file is bogus or can not be read."
---&gt; "are no sources" should be "are not sources", "you have to get sure" should be "you have to make sure".</p>

<p>Under 37.3.9, "The optional second parameter declares if translation is fix to the declared language or a lower set of translations can be used. "
---&gt; "is fix" should be "is fixed"</p>

<p>"Example 37.12. Checking if a text is translateable"
---&gt; "translateable" should be "translatable"</p>

<p>"37.3.10. Access to the source data</p>

<p>Of course sometimes it is usefull to have access to the translation source data. Therefor two functions exist. "
---&gt; "usefull" should be "useful", "therefor" should be "therefore".</p>
