    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>say you changed is_null() calls to use === in ZF-5413, why not improve array_key_exists -&gt; isset?</p>

<p>here's bare test on linux:</p>

<p>$ time php -r '$a=array("a"=&gt;1);for ($i=0; $i&lt;100000000;$i++){ isset($a["a"]);}'
real    0m10.655s
user    0m10.626s
sys     0m0.030s</p>

<p>$ time php -r '$a=array("a"=&gt;1);for ($i=0; $i&lt;100000000;$i++){ array_key_exists("a", $a);}'
real    0m49.931s
user    0m49.883s
sys     0m0.043s</p>

            <p>Because array_key_exists() behaves differently from isset() when null values come into play. Proposing to close as not an issue.</p>

            <p>I suppose it could be changed out in a few components where doing so would not change behavior but I think in a lot of cases as Dolf says, it has been used intentionally instead of isset().</p>

<p>(EDIT) Is there a specific component or code fragment that you see where you propose to replace array_key_exists() with isset()?</p>

            <p>40 seconds over 100 million calls!</p>

<p>Thats 0.0000004 of a second per call!</p>

<p>This only shows that the performance difference is negligible, and so the usage should be determined by the behaviour desired, and not the performance involved.</p>

<p>if this sort of difference were apparent over only 1000 or so calls I may have been convinced.</p>

            <p>As noted by others, array_key_exists() and isset() will return different results for the same context in a variety of situations. In many instances, one is chosen over the other with those contexts in mind. Additionally, as also noted, the performance difference is negligible for most common operations; we simply will not be calling the operators often enough for this to be anything other than a micro-optimization.</p>

<p>Yes, in many cases, we use "null === $value" instead of "is_null($value)" -- this, too, is really just a micro-optimization, and likely we should not introduce such changes unless there is a true semantic need.</p>

<p>Closing as "won't fix" -- I don't see any overwhelming evidence showing a benefit, and in fact see a number of cases where making the change would break code.</p>
