    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I was running default Zend_Http_Client over several sites to check some particular links when I received the following fatal error from one:
Error Message : Unsupported operand types
Error Location : C:\wamp\lib\ZendFramework-1.9.6\library\Zend\Http\Client\Adapter\Socket.php line 388</p>

<p>The response header I was seeing this...</p>

<p>The problem is that 'Content-Length' is included twice in this header (i guess this makes it malformed) and Zend_Http_Response::extractHeaders($response_str) [line 493, called from Zend_Http_Adapter_Socket line 314] consequently assigns the 'Content-Length' value in it's header return array as follows:
bq.'Content-Length' =&gt; array(0=&gt;185,1=&gt;185)
...rather than just the value:
bq.'Content-Length' =&gt; 185</p>

<p>This then becomes a problem in Zend_Http_Adapter_Socket line 388 where the fatal erros is caused when it's assumed 'Content-Length' is an integer rather than an array (an attempt is made to perform addition with it).</p>

<p>Sorry I'm a bit of a Zend Framework newbie so I'm uncertain as to what the best solution solution is, but presumably it's a good idea to check for this so that a fatal error is not thrown due to 'Content-Length' being included.</p>

<p>Perhaps similar sanity checks should also be made on some of the other header items?</p>

<p>P.S. I have absolutely no idea what 'X-Would-Your-GrandPa-Would-Wait' is about!!</p>
