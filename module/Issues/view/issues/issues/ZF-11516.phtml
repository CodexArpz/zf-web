            <p>Kim, I've cleaned up your patch a little (modified formatting and output messages to match existing code, removed some unnecessary lines) and added code to remove the {{layoutsDirectory}} entry from {{.zfproject.xml}} when {{zf disable layout}} is called.</p>

<p>I've attached the patch, and will commit it soon.  Can you try it out for me first to make sure the changes I added are OK?</p>

            <p>Adam,</p>

<p>I will try this later but it seems like the layout directory is deleted too. I think we don't want to do that. A good layout may end up to be deleted accidentally. There should be a separate action for this, for example {{zf remove layout}}.</p>

            <p>Adam,</p>

<p>I have now tested your patch. I see that it only removes these lines from {{.zfproject.xml}}</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre>

<p>and leaves the {{/application/layouts}} directory untouched. It's good that it really does not remove that directory. However, the {{.zfproject.xml}} is now out of sync what's the real directory structure. I still think that disabling layout should only remove the layout resource from {{application/configs/application.ini}} and leave the project structure untouched - including {{.zfproject.xml}}.</p>

            <p>I agree with Kim on this -- disabling is not the same as removing, and I'd worry that re-enabling later would try to overwrite files.</p>

<p>Speaking of which: what happens when you call "zf enable layout" after calling "zf disable layout"? I would expect in this case the following:</p>

<ul><li>"disable" would remove or comment out the application.ini entry</li>
<li>"enable" after a disable would add or uncomment the application.ini entry, and check to see if a  entry exists; if not, it creates it. It also checks to see if the layout.phtml file exists; if so, it does nothing, but if not, it creates it.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Valid point; I hadn't considered that .zfproject.xml would end up out of sync with the actual project directory structure.</p>

<p>In the patch I attached {{zf disable layout}} removes the layout config entry from application.ini and associated layout information from .zfproject.xml, but leaves the layout scripts intact.</p>

<p>When you call {{zf enable layout}} after calling {{zf disable layout}} it will add the {{resources.layout.layoutPath}} entry in [production] section.  Unless run in pretend mode, {{zf enable layout}} always calls {{Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Layout::createResource}}, which updates the .zfproject.xml file with the structure Kim outlined in his comment on 30/Jun/2011 @ 2:26PM.  If i'm reading the code correctly, then {{zf enable layout}} will always overwrite the existing layout script file, ( {{Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Layout::enable}} always calls {{$layoutScriptFile-&gt;create()}})</p>

<p>Should we consider changing that behaviour? ie: {{zf disable layout}} comments out layout lines in application.ini, {{zf enable layout}} enables commented-out lines (or creates new ones if they don't already exist) and doesn't overwrite an existing layout file</p>

            <p>@Matthew
Based on your comments I have rejigged the fix:
* Don't overwrite an existing layout file when calling {{zf enable layout}} after {{zf disable layout}}
* Don't remove {{layoutsDirectory}} tree from .zfproject.xml</p>

<p>Should we also implement a {{zf remove layout}} function as Kim mentioned above, ie: deletes all traces of {{zf enable layout}} having ever been run?</p>

            <p>Adam - looks like you really fix it. I was struggling with the following use case, but you fix it ...</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
zf create project ZF-11516
cd ZF-11516
zf enable layout
zf disable layout
rm application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml
zf enable layout # should create layout.phtml
</code></pre>

<p>bq. Should we also implement a zf remove layout function as Kim mentioned above, ie: deletes all traces of zf enable layout having ever been run?</p>

<p>I think that it's not a good idea to delete all traces of zf enable layout. For example, one may have multiple layout files under {{application/layouts/scripts}}. Thus zf remove layout should take additional parameter to tell the tool which layout file will be removed etc. Because of this additional overhead, I wouldn't implement this function as we don't know do we really need this - or what do you think?</p>

            <p>Thank you both for your feedback.  I've merged the fix into release-1.11 in r24408</p>

<p>As for a {{zf remove layout}}, I'm fine with omitting it.  I didn't see a solid use case for it, but if you did I would have implemented it anyway.</p>
