    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>i have found out that at least the IE 7 has a Problem when two inputs have the same value for id and name like 
</p>

<p>, because when trying to get the checkbox in javascript by getElementById always the hidden field is returned. This can be solved by changing the outputorder of the both fields:
</p>

<p>The affected class is Zend_View_Helper_FormCheckbox:</p>

<p>The code need to be changed like this:</p>

<p>// build the element
        $xhtml = '';</p>

<pre><code>    $xhtml .= '&lt;input type="checkbox"'
            . ' name="' . $this-&gt;view-&gt;escape($name) . '"'
            . ' id="' . $this-&gt;view-&gt;escape($id) . '"'
            . ' value="' . $this-&gt;view-&gt;escape($checkedValue) . '"'
            . $checked
            . $disabled
            . $this-&gt;_htmlAttribs($attribs)
            . $endTag;
    if (!strstr($name, '[]')) {
        $xhtml.= $this-&gt;_hidden($name, $unCheckedValue);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Regards,</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The problem with switching the output order is that the primary behavior we are trying to allow -- submission of an "unchecked" value when the checkbox is not checked -- will now not work correctly. When the form is submitted, the value of the last element with the given name will be returned -- in the case of your change, the unchecked value would always be returned.</p>

            <p>I'm surprised that IE is using the name when you try to select by ID -- that's really, really broken behavior (the hidden element does not have an ID, if you look closely).</p>

<p>Have you tried using jquery, dojo.query, etc for selecting nodes in IE? do you get the same issue?</p>

            <p>I know. That was the first thing i was wondering about. But when i  used the Microsoft Script Debugger i saw it black on white. 
After i fetched the Element by ID my javascript variable keeped the hidden-field object. I couldn't believed it myself. After i made the code change i mentioned above everything worked fine in all browsers.</p>

<p>We use the YUI framework. First i used the Dom.get-Method and i thought this would be the problem, but then i got the same results by using document.getElementById(); The scripts were still referenced, maybe thats an issue? I will try to remove them and look what will happen.</p>

            <p>I have created a very simple testside for checking if tis misbehaviour comes from our used framework or not.</p>

<p>The error happens not, because we use the framework. It seems that it is in fact an IE bug. Here is my simple form:</p>



Checkbox



<p>When executing this Firefox outputs "checkbox", IE 7 means "hidden".</p>
