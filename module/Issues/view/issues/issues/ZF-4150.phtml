    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I use zend translator with my forms to translate error messages, and it goes well. But this doesn't work with file form element.
I found a fix and I place the diff in attachment.</p>

<p>To fix the problem I try to reproduce the behavior of the other form elements.
So first, the Zend_Form_Element_File#isValid function had to pass the translator on the transfer adapter by using the Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Abstract#setTranslator method. Then, the transfer adapter does the same thing by calling setTranslator on validators that have the method (such as Zend_Validate_Abstract).
The last thing that need to be added, is the Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Abstract#setTranslator method. Normally, validators have this method, but the transfer adapter inherits from Zend_Validate_Interface and not Zend_Validate_Abstract. In the fix, I suggest to change the inheritance because it doesn't need a lot of changes. But I think that require more cpu and memory usage and perhaps that will cause others problems.</p>

<p>I work on the 11181 Zend Framework revision.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            <p>Which part of the code affects these new features ?
An other solution may be to call :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
parent::isValid($value, $context);
</code></pre>

<p>in the Zend_Form_Element_File#isValid method. But I think this would require more modifications.</p>

<p>Otherwise how can this bug be fixed ? I use a lot of translation with forms and I would appreciate a solution with file elements.
If I can help by suggesting other solutions, I volunteer.</p>

            <p>Not sure what happened to the original person who reported this, but this doesn't appear to be fixed in 1.6.2</p>

<p>If you specify a translator via Zend_Form using setDefaultTranslator, the translator is still null when processed by Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Abstract.php so the error message is not being translated.</p>
