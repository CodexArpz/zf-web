            <p>Fixed by no longer referencing the undefined variable $source.  Sending out request for code review to fw-gdata allow for this to be released with the next release.</p>

            <p><em>Review for r6732:</em></p>

<p>I don't see anything wrong with the changes made. Feel free to merge this into release-1.0.</p>

<p>However, is there a reason that getHttpClient() isn't being called anywhere here? This looks like the sort of thing that could have easily been caught with a unit test.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the review Trevor.</p>

<p>Agreed that getHttpClient could be called to generate the header and avoid duplicate code (in this method and others).  Filed as <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2145">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2145</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, it could be caught in a unit test, if we used mock HTTP client classes, but we haven't used those yet for Zend_Gdata.  Filed as:

            <p>While mock HTTP clients would certainly be nice, in this case we just would have had to check that getHttpClient() is returning a properly instantiated instance of Zend_Http_Client.</p>

            <p>Gotcha, I thought you were mentioning that we needed testing on AuthSubRevokeToken(sic), which couldn't be tested fully without a mock client.  Testing getHttpClient can be tested, and would have caught this problem (as you pointed out) if we were using getHttpClient in the other methods.</p>

<p>Thanks Trevor!
