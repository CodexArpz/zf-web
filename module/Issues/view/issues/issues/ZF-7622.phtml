            <p>Acknowledged.</p>

<p>I've lowered the priority to Major, since this doesn't block development of the library itself.</p>

            <p>I know thats it probably too soon to even tell, but any idea on when this would be implemented?</p>

<p>Otherwise I have strip the gdata api out of my project and create my own.</p>

            <p>As much as I hate to say it, probably not anytime soon (unless somebody besides me writes and submits a patch).</p>

<p>There's other issues that are higher priority, and have been open for a while now. Those would come first.</p>

            <p>If you want to add a shipping tag I recommend creating the xml manually. For example:</p>

<p>And sending it using
$client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $service);
$gdata = new Zend_Gdata_Gbase($client);
$gdata-&gt;updateEntry($data, $itemUrl);</p>

<p>This way you'll reuse the http request handling included in the Zend Framework.</p>

            <p>Zend_Gdata_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0.  The classes remain, but will throw a {{Zend_Exception}} when instantiated.
