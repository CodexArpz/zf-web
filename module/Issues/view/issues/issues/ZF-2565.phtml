    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The Flickr API method flickr.groups.pools.getPhotos allows to grab photos from group pools and optionally filter by a tag.
I've extended the Zend_Service_Flickr class for my own use and would love for it to be part of the official release. Below is proposed new function. 
The _validateGroupPoolGetPhotos() method is identical to the original _validateUserSearch() short of the addition of 'tags' as a valid option.</p>

<p>I'm not sure the method names are optimal but it was the best I could come up with :/
If I'm making mistakes please bear with me, it's my first post as a contributor.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] Attached suggested improvement as a patch file</p>

            <p>Looks good to me, thanks for providing this patch! :) Would you be interested in contributing this, accompanying unit tests and documentation?</p>

<p>Tiny thing: I did notice that the {{$query}} parameter can be {{array|string}}, not just {{string}}.</p>

            <p>Been having a few issues with my PHPUnit not working with xdebug enabled on my Mac/Leopard install.</p>

<p>I am not sure the testGroupPoolGetPhotosBasic() test is needed - it is basically a copy of the testTagSearchBasic(). The needed files in the _files dir seems to be omitted by svn in generating the diff?</p>

<p>The array bug found by Darby has been fixed.</p>

<p>Could someone please review the patch and check if all is well.</p>

Also corrected a missing valid option user_id.</p>

            <p>I think the next step is to commit the changes to the SVN repository. I'll send your SVN credentials in an e-mail shortly. :)</p>

            <p>If you committed a patch for this issue, 
added unit tests 
and probably added some docu which describe it,</p>

<p>then you should close this issue, as "resolved" ;-)</p>

            <p>It is not included in 1.5.0.</p>

<p>Zend_Service_Flickr seems to be at revision 8064 in 1.5.0 whereas latest commit related to this issue is revision 8733 (and 8886 for accompanying tests).</p>

            <p>Merging revisions 8733 and 8734 to the release-1.5 branch would get these features into the next mini release (1.5.2), or as they are new features, they could wait for next minor release (1.6.0).</p>
