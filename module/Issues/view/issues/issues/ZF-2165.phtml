    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I recently installed Fedora 7, previously was on Fedora Core 6. Also upgraded ZF to 1.02. The following code was working under under FC 6, but does not work now. I get an html 500 error, using , firefox 2, IE-7,IE-6.</p>

<p>require_once 'Zend/Feed.php';
// Fetch the latest Slashdot headlines
try { 
$slashdotRss = Zend_Feed::import($site);
} catch (Zend_Feed_Exception $e) { 
// feed import failed 
echo "Exception caught importing feed: {$e-&gt;getMessage()}\n";
echo "<br />report problem to webmaster<br />";
// exit;
}// Initialize the channel data array</p>

<p>It dies when trying to catch the exception, no error just stops. The $site variable is set correctly. The URL works from the browser address line so I know it is still there. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I suppose this is your problem <a href="http://www.nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154.html">http://nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154â€¦</a></p>

<p>Could you post here the URL for the feed you are trying to load?
I mean, the value of $site variable.</p>

            <p>I apologize for not posting the fix on this forum. It turned out I was missing the DOMDocument class. 
Apparently Fedora 7 and 8 do not contain it as a default.</p>

<p>I finally started to look at the log files and they told me what was wrong. 
I kind of got busy and forgot to post the answer. I hope this helps someone else.</p>

<p>This was the error message in the log file</p>

<p>[Wed Oct 31 02:59:46 2007] [error] [client 192.168.3.1] PHP Fatal error:  Class 'DOMDocument' not found in /usr/local/lib</p>

<p>/php/Zend/library/Zend/Feed.php on line 195,</p>

<p>I subsequently loaded the missing class using an rpm and all was well.</p>
