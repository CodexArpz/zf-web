    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>ZendFramework is getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Even if we, ZF developpers, master our object dependencies, I noticed that some components do require_once other classes that they won't use in any future way.</p>

<p>I suggest that any patch that correct such a behavior (i.e : suppress a require_once) should reference that bug number in its commit text.</p>

<p>Please, do not close that bug report as it will always be up to date (we can assume that we will always have to track not needed dependencies)</p>

            <p>I <em>am</em> going to close this bug report, as it is too broad and not detailed enough.</p>

<p>The current plan is to gradually remove <em>all</em> require_once statements in favor of autoloading. However, this must be done over a period of releases, and likely not completely until 2.0. It will be far easier to simply remove all require_once statements than to comb through the code and make unconditional requires conditional. Additionally, there are many performance benefits to doing so.</p>
