    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Just updated from subversion and I'm throwing an exception some of the time when rendering the view script.</p>

<p>On line 426 or so of Zend/View/Abstract.php is
    protected function _script($name)</p>

<p>$name is being past complete with path sometimes, but with only script name other times.  If the complete path is passed, then the script path is prepended to it, the file will not be found and an exception is thrown.</p>

<p>I'll look deeper and try to come up w/ a fix.</p>

            <p>Looks like this is not a bug, but I was getting away with an error in my controller scripts (including full path of view script) in a couple places.  Somehow this was tolerated up until recently.  Now it throws an exception.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The design of Zend_View has always been that you should specifically set a view directory, and refer to scripts relatively within that directory. If you need to use absolute paths, you can always add '/' as a view script path.</p>
