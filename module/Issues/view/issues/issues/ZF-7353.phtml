    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When you rely on Zend_Application for setting PHP's include path, it actually <em>prepends</em> the paths we set up to the actual include path.</p>

<p>I think an option should be proposed to the developer if he wants defined include paths to be prepended or appended to its actual include path.</p>

<p>Think about ZF being at first position in the PHP.INI include path for performance reasons. Using then Zend_Application puts all the defined include path <em>before</em> ZendFramework, and this is not good for performances as the performance documentation chapter reminds us.</p>

<p>We could do something like this :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
public function setIncludePaths(array $paths, $append = false)
    {
        $path = implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $paths);
        if (!$append) {
        set_include_path($path . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
        } else {
        set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . paths);
        }
        return $this;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>$append should be configurable throught Zend_Application (aka passing it via a Zend_Config object should be possible)</p>

            <p>looks to me that it appends the path already?</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$path = implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $paths);
        set_include_path($path . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
        return $this;

            <p>Zend_Application prepends them as the assumption is that these are paths for your application and library code -- and as such should have preference over ZF code itself (for instance, consider if you have patched versions of ZF class files -- you can maintain them in your own version control and have them found while still using svn:externals or systemwide ZF install for the full library).</p>

<p>If you have a very specific include_path you need to use for performance reasons, it's often better to set this in your php.ini or vhost definition.</p>
