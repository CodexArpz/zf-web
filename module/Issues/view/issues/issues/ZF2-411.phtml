    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>With the check for int 0 in haystack at the start of InArray::isValid, comparing input against ints becomes impossible unless strict mode is enabled. Of course, if trying to compare string "0" against int 0, then it's impossible as a strict check will fail, and you don't have the option to not use strict mode owing to the exception being thrown because int 0 is in haystack.</p>

<p>Fix is simple - remove the check that throws an exception at the start of the method along with the unit test. Maybe a better unit test should be devised that tests "0" against array(0,5,10) which passes with strict false, and fails on strict true.</p>

<p>The original 'issue' (<a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-337">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-337</a>) where the developer is comparing a string against an int 0 will return true when any string that doesn't start with a digit is tested against int 0. The original bug report is incorrect, "6asdf" will return 6, not int 0 as suggested by the bug reporter.  That's correct PHP behaviour and a bug of the developer, not a bug of ZF2.</p>

            <p>Against "asdf6" will be valid.</p>

<p>You can write your own validator extending from the original if you need a different behavior, but IMHO must exists a code to warning the developer about unexpected behaviors due a the ""normal"" behavior of PHP.</p>

            <p>No need to extend, this is now broken. It's not the framework's job to report upon gotcha's on PHP. With the check it prevents testing strings against int 0. This is a fairly major zf bug.</p>

<p>Again, ZF2 should not modify expected behaviour of PHP.</p>
