    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>ZF currently has requirements for PHP version and some extensions (<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html">manual</a>), but checking, whether your webhost (or your client webhost) offers all which are required, may be boring and error prone.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have some script, which will compare required features and features enabled on current host.</p>

<p>There is a nice example in Czech PHP Framework Nette - <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.nettephp.com%2Fcs%2Fpozadavky-frameworku&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en">Requirements Checker</a> (google translated, but understandable).</p>

            <p>Seems like something that could be resolved using unit tests with a special grouping. Exclude the "requirements" group from "AllTests" and include this group in something like "AllRequirments". Provide user documentation on how to run this set of tests from the command-line.</p>

<p>If this is approved it can be assigned to me.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear other suggestions if the above isn't a viable solution.</p>

            <p>It should be a provider for Zend_Tool.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
zf check requirements
</code></pre>

<p>But the requirements depends on the components really used.
Thomas Weidner use something to update our requirements tables in documentation but I can't remember the name of the tool.</p>

<p>Edit: it's PHP_CompatInfo</p>

            <p>I primary meant it as a single php file which you can easily run on your hosting to determine if it is suitable for ZF.</p>

<p>If it is going to be a part of Zend_Tool or unit tests, it wouldn't be so easy to run it there.</p>

<p>Martin,</p>

<p>This is exactly why I suggested the phpunit approach -- if you have shell access with your host, you should be able to run phpunit; however, after reading Mickael's latest comment regarding PHP_CompatInfo and looking into the component, I think it would be fairly straight-forward to create a PHP script that runs through the requirements.</p>

<p>The toughest part is deciding what to test for since requirements depend on what components you want to use. I suppose the tool could run through everything and report what you can and can't use based on your environment.</p>

<p>Such a tool might end up being pretty cool.</p>

            <p>I have updated link to Nette Requirements Checker - that's what I think that this tool should do (+display, which ZF components won't work properly because: ...)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the updated link. This could be a really nice component actually. I would suggest a web and command-line interface. I'd be willing to work on this but I would need some guidance as to the correct approach since there doesn't seem to be anything documented as to conventions for something that needs a full blown web interface (or I just don't know where to look).</p>
