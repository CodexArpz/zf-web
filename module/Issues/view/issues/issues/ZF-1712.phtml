        <p>It would be good to have barcode printing functionality.</p>

<p>It can be done with a special internal (named) font.</p>

            <p>Barcodes are something that I've recently had to deal with (although not in PDFs, I can definitely see the benefit).  However, there are many types of barcodes.  Two of the most prevalent are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128">Code 128</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39">Code 39</a>.</p>

<p>Code 39 is the one that can be done with a font.  Each letter is assigned a specific set of bars, and it has a special start and stop character (often encoded as an * in the font), which helps assure that the entire barcode is scanned.</p>

<p>Code 128, however, goes one step further.  In addition to the start/stop characters, it actually has a check digit that verifies accurate scans.  However, this can't be done simply with a font.  There is a lot more to do.  The check digit needs to be calculated and created from the data that is being encoded.  Also, there are rules as to the size of a code 128 barcode.  The advantage is both reliability and flexibility, because code 128 supports more characters.</p>

<p>I'd like to see both options made available.  There are other options as well, Code93, EAN13/UPCA, EAN8/UPCE, Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5, Standard 2 of 5, Code 11, MSI, etc.  However, Code 128 and Code 39 seem to be the most prevalent.</p>

            <p>This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.</p>

            <p>This missing functionality will be addressed by the Zend_Image_Barcode component ( <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43220">http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/â€¦</a> ).</p>

<p>I think I can safely close it for now...</p>
