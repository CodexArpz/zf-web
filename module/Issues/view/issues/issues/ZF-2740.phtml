    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, Zend_Form's multi-field validation states that a second variable, $context, is passed into the isValid() method, however, the Zend_Validate_Interface::isValid() signature only has the $value parameter. Adding a $context variable to a class that implements Zend_Validate_Interface thus fails "Declaration of My_Validator::isValid() must be compatible with that of Zend_Validate_Interface::isValid()".</p>

            <p>Implementation of {{Zend_Validate_Interface::isValid()}} does not include any {{$context}} parameter, hence the error you're seeing. This is normal PHP behavior when implementing any interface. What do you suggest as a solution to the confusion? Any validation class can implement another method, such as {{setContext($context)}}, so we need not change {{Zend_Validate_Interface}}.</p>

            <p>Well, it's more of a Zend_Form problem because they're passing a second variable, $context, to isValid(). A better ticket summary would be, why was this method chosen for doing multi-field validation when one already existed (ie Zend_Filter_Input's "fields" option)?</p>

            <p>What version of PHP are you using? I have run the following with error reporting set to E_ALL | E_STRICT with no errors:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
class My_Validate_Test implements Zend_Validate_Interface
{
    public function isValid($value, $context = null)
    {   
        return true;
    }

    public function getErrors()
    {   
        return array();
    }

    public function getMessages()
    {   
        return array();
    }
}

$t = new My_Validate_Test();
</code></pre>

<p>When implementing interfaces, as long as you only have as many <em>required</em> parameters as the interface specifies for a method, you will get no errors; however, if you add additional required parameters, you break the interface.</p>

<p>It was with this rationale that we decided to allow an <em>optional</em> second parameter to isValid(), $context. This would allow passing the full context to <em>any</em> validator; however, only if the validator required it would they have it in their method signature.</p>

<p>Does specifying the $context parameter as optional, as in my example above, cause the error to go away? If not, what version of PHP are you using, so I can determine if this will be an issue with our minimum specified PHP version?</p>

<p>Regardless, I'm making a note to specify in the Zend_Form documentation that this parameter should be declared optional to conform with the Zend_Validate_Interface interface.</p>

            <p>Justin: re: why isn't Zend_Filter_Input's fields option used: the simple reason is because Zend_Form does not use Zend_Filter_Input. ZFI is good for collections of data, but Zend_Form sets up validation and filter chains <em>per element</em> -- to allow re-use of elements in multiple forms, as well as to allow validation of partial sets of data (or even individual elements). ZFI just was not a good fit for Zend_Form.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response on the optional parameters and Interfaces. I was unaware of this behavior. I made the changes you suggested and the fatal error is no longer occurring.</p>

<p>If I may, I'd like to elaborate on my concern about the use of $context instead of using the existing Zend_Validate_Interface behavior (of passing in values as an array when more than one is specified). Consider the following:</p>

<p>class StringEquals extends Zend_Validate_Abstract {
 // other stuff here
 public function isValid($values) {
  $first = current($values);
  foreach ($values as $value) {
   if ($value != $first) {
    return false;
   }
   return true;
 }
}</p>

<p>class PasswordConfirmation extends Zend_Validate_Abstract {
 // other stuff here
 public function isValid($value, $context = null) {
  return $value == $context['confirm_password'];
 }
}</p>

<p>The concern I have is that I can't use PasswordConfirmation in ZFI and I can't use StringEquals in Form, despite each class have the same interface. I find this a bit messy as it doesn't conform to good OOP design.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought this was a problem with ZFI and Form, but I looked a little deeper and found a similar problem with Zend_Validate_Interface. Multi-value validators can't be used without passing in an array of values and single-value validators can't be used when an array is passed in. Again, two classes, same interface, but not interchangeable.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Zend_Validate_Interface was not designed to be able to validate multiple values. No where in the source or documentation was I able to find any reference to the functionality. It seems like ZFI wanted to do multiple value validation, hacked a solution around the interface and it kind of stuck.</p>

<p>Now maybe I'm nit-picking and blowing smoke, but all of this feels pretty awkward. The existing design is probably sufficient, you just have to know which validators can be used in which situations. Documenting these caveats would be enough. My inner OOP voice still yells out though. It seems like there should be a second interface in Zend_Validate for multi-value validation.</p>

<p>I'm sorry about the length of this, I'm kind of rambling on about things that are a bit more detailed than a simple trouble ticket, but I hope that I've at least made my concern clear. Feel free to completely ignore me now. :)</p>

            <p>I agree that this should be fixed to make sure all components - ZFI, Zend_Form, and Zend_Validate can play well together. However, I don't think there's time to analyze and improve this for the 1.5.0GA release, and so am de-scheduling it; we'll review after that point.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm marking it with only the component Zend_Validate, as that's the primary pain point; we can modify this after Zend_Validate has been reviewed.</p>

            <p>PHP's method definitions allow for additional optional arguments in extending/implementing classes. This provides the simplest, most straight-forward solution to the problem at hand of optionally allowing and utilizing extra parameters to provide context to the validator.</p>

<p>Won't fix.</p>
