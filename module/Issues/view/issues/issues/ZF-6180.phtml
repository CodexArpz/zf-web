    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>One of the cool things was the true possibility to watch php language errors and warnings on the php classes code, or trow the error/warning from php to flex/flash.</p>

<p>Recently i used zendAMF on a huge project, and each time i got a php error or warning, it simple outputs on flex/flash debugger the .BadVersion typical code, and beacause there is no code browser, it is not possible to test all the php code, so each time i got an error on flash/flex and got errors from zendAMF i need to watch my server apache logs to really see what's the php class error.</p>

<p>I think this could be solved also with a simple code browser / class tester like the one on amfPHP.</p>

            <p>Yes this would be a very very very handy feature. Working in PHP and debugging is so much more painful than the Flex Builder IDE experience. The errors that come back to Flex from a failed PHP call are very cryptic.</p>

<p>A simple solution for class browser/test would go a long way to making Zend AMF usable.</p>
