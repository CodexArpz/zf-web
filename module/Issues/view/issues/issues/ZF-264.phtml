    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p></p>

<p>Problem 1:</p>

<p>First the rfc states lines have a 76 character (encoded form) hard limit in length. This limit while implemented isnt working quite right. Lines regularily reach 80 chars.</p>

<p>This is due to the tack on of the =20 after the split (see second line) the other lines I think are over by one character but I might just be counting wrong.</p>

<p>IE:</p>

<p>man",Times,serif; color: #666; margin-bottom: 5px; line-height: 1.5em; borde=
r-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px; }=0A=09=09h2 {=20=
font-size: 14px; color: #666; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5em; borde=</p>

<p>Problem 2:</p>

<p>= line endings, aka soft breaks.</p>

<p>Im not sure why, and I dont see in the RFC any explanation but my email clients all have a problem with the following line ending scenario</p>

<p>An encoded entity, followed by a softbreak, immediately followed by another encoded identity</p>

<p>Eg</p>

<p>=09=09US<br />=0A=09=09=09=09=09Phone #: 1<br />=0A=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=
=09</p>=0A=09=09=09=0A=09=09=09=0A=09=09=09=09=

This will always result in an = sign being printed on the line below Phone #:1. My intutition is that if the following line begins with an identity, the soft-break = should be omitted, though I cant find anything in the rfc to back this up.

            <p>Update.</p>

<p>Chanign the line ending from \r\n to \n by itself resolves this error in a functional way. The new resultant output however, appears RFC invalid.</p>

            <p>I seem to have similar problems.</p>

<p>GMX mangles mails sent with Zend/Mail. It does convert the softbreaks to real line breaks. Also when using POP3.
I suspect their spamfilter but I don't know what to do about it. Having 8-bit encoding would probably fix this. I'm not sure about workarounds.</p>

            <p>We use Zend Framework and especially Zend_Mail in our product SiteBuilder - <a href="http://www.swsoft.com/en/products/sitebuilder3/">http://www.swsoft.com/en/products/sitebuilder3/</a>
We have responce about this bug from our customers. LINEEND = "\r\n" really doesn't work correct all the time (many reports about using this with qmail installations). But using LINEEND = "\n" solves this problem. We had tested with many intallations of sendmail, postfix and qmail MTAs and LINEEND = "\n" always worked correctly.
So I suggest to apply fix into SVN.</p>

            <p>I saw that this wasn't addressed in the 0.7.0 release.</p>

<p>I realize that \r\n is the RFC but something in how it is implemented in ZF does not make several MTA's happy.</p>

<p>Here are problem mail servers/clients you can use to test.</p>

<p>With \r\n in Zend/Mime.php send a multi-part html/text email using quoted-printable.</p>

<p>Use QPopper on the local machine to retrieve mail to any mail client (i.e. Outlook) - HTML is shown badly broken</p>

<p>Send to a gmail account - html will be broken.</p>

<p>Send to Exchange 5, Lotus Groupware (just about any version) - html broken.</p>

<p>gmail is probably the easiest test for this project to use.</p>

            <p>I've patched the Zend/Mime.php file in revision 4310. Please update from SVN and test. It still passes all unit tests, but I want to be sure that it resolves the problems reported by each of you.</p>

<p>Garth -- the reason for the pushback has been a simple lack of time to address all my areas of responsibility in the framework. I apologize -- it's indeed a trivial fix, but it's been entirely off my radar.</p>

            <p>I checked the SVN history and see that all you changed was the LINEEND line - that is what I have always changed - so this change will work with the mailers I outlined above - including gmail.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Changing LINEEND does not resolve this bug. Its a tempfix at best. The larger issue here is RFC invalid quoted printable support.</p>
