    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Environment: Windows XP
PHP 5.2.1
PHPUnit 3.1.0beta4
Xdebug 2.0.0RC4</p>

<p>When running the unit tests for Zend_DateTest, if Xdebug is enabled and I run PHPUnit with the "--report" option to request code-coverage reporting, some of the tests take almost 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Specifically, here are the longest-running tests:
- testSet(), 59 sec.
- testAdd(), 57 sec.
- testSub(), 47 sec.
- testAddDate(), 29 sec.
- testSubDate(), 19 sec.</p>

<p>I understand that these tests are doing many sub-tests, so it is natural that they take a long time.  But even with this in mind, this seems like the tests take a long time.  Is this an indication that the performance of the Date component should be analyzed and improved?</p>

            <p>There are four things which slows the tests for Zend_Date:</p>

<p>1.) Having "--report" set, phpunit needs much more time for tests. The needed time raises extrem for unit tests where much tests are done (beginning with 200 tests and above per test class). Also "--report" remembers the line which was executed. So having a loop or a program piece which is executed several times (for-loop with f.e. 500 executions) also slows unit tests.</p>

<p>2.) These test methods consist of about 200-400 tests for each testcase. With about 30-60 testcases. So we have about 5000 tests. We could split the tests for Set to several test methods but I am not sure if this would increase speed.</p>

<p>3.) Within all of this functions we are not only testing dates within the php range but also dates like 1.1.2500 or 1.1.-20. These dates take much more time because the calculation it much more complicated and outside php's 32bit timestamp range.</p>

<p>4.) If the BCMath extension is not installed, the internal BCMath class takes also more time for calculation for extended timestamps.</p>

<p>To increase speed of unit tests we would have to
1.) erase some of the tests
2.) split the test classes into several classes, but the testing time for the whole framework would not be changed by this
3.) Execute the unit tests without -report which makes the unit tests to be executed about 2-4 times faster.</p>

<p>To increase speed of Zend_Date we would have to delete the extended timestamps and make Zend_Date only work with 32bit php timestamps.</p>

<p>The testbed for Zend_Date is the only testbed where more than 5000 tests are done in one class.
The massive ammount of tests is the main reason in my opinion why this test takes longer than any other test.
We wanted to be sure that ALL thinkable options and possibilities work like expected.
If we only want to have 100% code coverage we could strip 2/3 of the tests... but I think this would be contraproductive ;-)</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas, yes that sounds right, I agree with the principles of testing many cases of input.</p>

<p>However, consider this measurement:  when I run all the tests from /tests/AllTests.php, somehow the Date tests take much more time than they do when I run only Zend_DateTest.  The time is so long that it seems that it will never finish.  Just to be sure, I let it run to completion, and I measure how long it takes.</p>

<p>Here are the tests that take over 60 seconds each when I run in this mode:
- testSet(): 1152 sec.
- testAdd(): 1159 sec. 
- testSub(): 957 sec.
- testAddDate(): 597 sec.
- testSubDate(): 386 sec.
- testCompareDate(): 99 sec.
- testAddIso(): 107 sec.
- testSubIso(): 98 sec.
- testCompareIso(): 93 sec.
- testAddArpa(): 222 sec.
- testSubArpa(): 124 sec.
- testCompareArpa(): 93 sec.
- testAddYear(): 84 sec.</p>

<p>That means it takes more than 90 minutes to run the Date tests when I need the code coverage report!</p>

<p>I don't know why it takes 20 times longer when we run the full collection of test suites.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to define a constant in the tests/TestConfiguration.php script that tells the Date tests to skip a lot of the tests?  Otherwise it takes too long to analyze code coverage for the whole ZF test run.</p>

<p>It would be good to have a subset of tests defined, and if a config value is set, then run only this subset, but not the full set of tests.  This subset of tests should provide good code coverage reports, but it is not necessary to be so comprehensive in the number of input values.  :-)</p>

<p>We can run the full set of tests by default, but if the config variable is set to its non-default state, only run the short list of tests.  So if someone needs to enable the code coverage report, he can set the config value in his local copy of TestConfiguration.php.  What do you think?</p>

            <p>{quote}I don't know why it takes 20 times longer when we run the full collection of test suites.{quote}</p>

<p>The reason is that phpunit collects all informations about which line was executed how often and this is done  for ALL testbeds. As some tests like the testbed "phpmath" which is executed BEFORE Zend_Date's testbed is executed 5000 times (gavin wanted to be sure that the round function is tested excessive).</p>

<p>So, the more lines are tested while running tests the slower phpunit will act.</p>

<p>When you are running only one testbed and not the full collection phpunit has only the testdata for this testbed to remember, and therefor it will act much faster ;-)</p>

<p>We will have this problem again when we add more unit tests or testbeds for new classes... the time will raise..</p>

<p>Btw:
There is a config value which allows the testbed to act with BCMath or use the own class... I think we should set it to use the php extension to fasten all I18N tests which use extended numbers.</p>

<p>I will look and extract some tests... so I think we should come from 90 minutes to 5-10 minutes which is acceptable.</p>

<p>PS: 
The other way to speed the tests is to make sure users which test the framework have minimum requirements of quad-processor, 8Ghz or higher, 6GB RAM, and no other running program in the background... (like windows) ;-)</p>

            <p>I added a new option "TESTS_ZEND_I18N_EXTENDED_COVERAGE".</p>

<p>Standard value is true.
If set to false all time expensive tests are skipped.</p>

<h2>I measured with a 1,6GHz Laptop 512MB RAM, Windows XP, reports set on, Xdebug installed</h2>

<p>With "true" the testbed takes about 10 minutes to finish (636 seconds)
With "false" the testbed takes about 30 seconds to finish (29 seconds)</p>
