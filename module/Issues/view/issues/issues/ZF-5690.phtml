    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I've been working with a cookie that has "expires=Sat, 29-Jan-2039 00:54:42 GMT" and it is never automatically added to the cookieJar. Upon some investigating I discovered that it is because isExpired() returns true for that cookie because when the is set fromString() the line $expires = strtotime($v); sets $expires to 0 (false). Upon investigating the manual for strtotime() I noticed that my cookie expiration date is outside the "maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer." If I alter the expiration date of the cookie to be before the maximum value (Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 UTC) the cookie expiration is properly set and properly passes isExpired().</p>

<p>Not sure how important it is to this but I am using PHP 5.2.8 on Mac OS X 10.5.6 with Zend Framework 1.7.4.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I'm not sure if this is considered OK as a fix/workaround but changing the strtotime() around line 307 to this seems to work:
$expireDate = new Zend_Date($v);
$expires = $expireDate-&gt;get(Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP);</p>

This fix adds a dependency on Zend_Date</p>

            <p>3 notes:
*) The dependency should not be hardcoded... when no expires is given you still load Zend_Date
*) You use Zend_Date also when the time does not extend the unix timestamp
*) You use get instead of getTimestamp which results in slower execution</p>

            <p>Thanks Thomas for the comments and J Cobb for the patch - I've mostly applied your patch except for making sure that (strtotime($v) === false) instead of just (! strtotime($v)) which does not necessarily indicate an error (might also be that the cookie is exactly set to expire on UNIX epoch).</p>
