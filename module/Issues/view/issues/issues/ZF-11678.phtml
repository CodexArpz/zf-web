    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I tried to decorate my form with a table, like in this Tutorial:
<a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/3450">http://devzone.zend.com/article/3450</a></p>

<p>Then I tried to enhance my form with AJAX in JQuery. I find it difficult to pass through the place where JQuery has to put the error messages, if theres no initial
"container" with an Id.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

</code></pre>

<p>Zend_Form contructs:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
The username is empty
</code></pre>

<p>With JQuery I can select the td with the class error, but only after the form was sent.</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

</code></pre>

<p>I can select it now with JQuery to display an AJAX message and if I set a css width on it I could better handle the layout of the table.</p>

<p>In Zend_Form_Decorator_Errors on line 54 we could do something like:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if (!self::ALLOWEMPTY || empty($errors)) {
    return $content;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should "fix" it.</p>

Sorry, that's completely wrong. Use jQuery:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre><code>
    </code>

            <p>Maybe you should have read better or I should express myself better ;)
But, there is no td the first time, because the error decorator only decorates if there is an error.
And if there is nothing, I can´t select it with jquery.</p>

            <p>But I see what u did there, but it does not solve the problem. The whole purpose is that u don´t know in JS where the decorator puts the error messages. With your solution you have to know where the JS has to put the error message. If theres a container in the first place which is correctly placed via decorator we could use it and don´t have to worry about placing in js.</p>

            <p>No, I don´t know it, because the Decorator can be anything and put the error everywhere. The Problem occurs if I change the decorators, now I have to maintain the code at 2 different places to account for the changes.</p>

<p>In this use case its a table, there will be empty td all the time.</p>

<p>To your other problem, its not a problem, because the standard behavior should be to not show the empty tag. But if u need it, you should be able to change that. And I for myself have a valid use case where I need it.
Imagine a generated form with dozens of input, the form generates all your stuff, but the JS u have to change for every input if u change something at the decorator.</p>

<p>Maybe I should mention that I build a custom formText view helper for that purpose which extends ZendX_JQuery_View_Helper_UiWidget.</p>

            <p>Forgot to say that I have to manually change that behavior and then I´m sure that I don´t do anything fancy to show some red boxes ;)</p>

            <p>My suggestion: write a error decorator for ZendX_JQuery which adds the JavaScript automatically.</p>

<p>By the way: Forms are not tabular data! (We no longer have 1997)</p>

            <p>Maybe you should tell Matthew that, because he did that in the tutorial above ;)</p>

<p>And the JQuery should be part of the form element, as in every element in the ZendX.</p>
