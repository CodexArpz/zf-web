        <div class="body">
            <p>This is the main issue for the first version of the main Zend Framework project's code generation facilities. There is no more information as a proposal has yet to be put together, and the only link with the Primitus project is that it is one of the inspirations for this tool. Stay tuned for a proposal, which will be linked to from this issue.</p>

            <p>This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.</p>

            <p>Looks like this issue was resolved by implementing Zend_CodeGenerator unless I am missing something.</p>
