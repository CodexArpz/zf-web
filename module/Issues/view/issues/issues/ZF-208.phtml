    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>As requested from Mislav to open this ticket.
Ability to set identifier as any kind of string
and not just "'Invalid id or tag : must use only [a-zA-A0-9_]'"</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$urlToSomeData = "http://api.example.com/give/me/cars/from/new_york/?sort=year";

if($data  = $cache-&gt;get($urlToSomeData)){
    //......
}else{
    $data = file_get_contents($urlToSomeData);
//.......
    $cache-&gt;save($data);
}

</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend some fast hashing function on the identifier string, which will produce file name, if this will not corrupt current Cache system.</p>

            <p>We have to take some time to think about that.</p>

<p>Because from my point of view, the md5() should be done by the user in such cases and not by Zend_Cache.</p>

<p>Let's take some time to consider this issue.</p>

            <p>The issue here is to decide how much would we allow to be a cache identifier. I think it's not right for a backend to limit us (like filesystem did). On the other hand, allowing everything would be expensive and maybe we'd have too much trouble with our backends</p>

            <p>I was thinking about implementing it for myself in a plugin with something along the lines of:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$identifier = preg_replace('#[^a-zA-Z0-9_]#', '_', $identifier) . '_' . abs(crc32($identifier));
</code></pre>

<p>I was under the impression that crc32 was a fast hashing algorithm, but I don't know how expensive this operation would be.
Or how useful the crc32 is...</p>

<p>Whatever the solution, perhaps the ability to have all characters in an identifier should be a configurable option, per Zend_Cache object?</p>

            <p>After taking some time, I think that the cache identifier must be a string.</p>

<p>If someone want to use a "not string" identifier, it's not difficult to call md5(serialize($yourId)) before calling Zend_Cache.</p>

<p>Let's keep "hacks" out of Zend_Cache.</p>

<p>So I close this task</p>
