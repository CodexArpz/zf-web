    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have the following:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$vFileSize = new \Zend_Validate_File_FilesSize('2MB');
$vFileSize-&gt;setMessage('My own message');

$file = new \Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
$file-&gt;addValidator($vFileSize);
</code></pre>

<p>But I will always get the error message of Zend_Validate_File_Upload if the filesize is too big:</p>

<p>File 'file' exceeds the defined ini size.</p>

            <p>There is a limitation from PHP itself, which is handles by the upload validator.
The upload validator returns only the error which is produced by the upload itself... it is limited by php's internal settings.
You can expect this to be sort of a hardware limitation.</p>

<p>And then you can set a own (softwarebased) file size limitation.
The FilesSize validator gets only involved when the files have been uploaded to the server.</p>

<p>So as conclusion:
Upload validator =&gt; BEFORE the file has been uploaded to the server
FilesSize =&gt; AFTER the file has been uplaoded to the server</p>

<p>This is not a failure. It is a limitation of php itself.
And that's also the reason why you get 2 different messages in return.
One before the file is on the server (there is a upload-problem by php), and one after validating the file which is already uploaded.</p>
