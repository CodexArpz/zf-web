    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Some servers don't allow to set PHP variables as magic_quotes_gpc in .htaccess (i.e. php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off). It would be convenient (as it is recommended) to get raw parameters from request independently of magic_quotes_gpc value.</p>

            <p>Remember that not only input data are affected by magic_quotes_gpc, but also parse_str().
Shouldn't that be one of Filter_Input features?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>As far as I know, if magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, it is not possible to get raw parameter values.  PHP inserts slashes to values in the GET/POST/COOKIE superglobals before PHP code can access them.  That's the point of that feature: to make sure that your PHP app cannot access tainted data.</p>

<p>So there is nothing we can do in Zend Framework to provide the requested functionality if magic_quotes_gpc is enabled.</p>

<p>Workarounds:
- disable magic_quotes_gpc in php.ini;
- disable magic_quotes_gpc in .htaccess;
- move your PHP application to a different server that permits one of the above changes;
- use stripslashes() to undo the quoting, if get_magic_quotes_gpc() returns 1.</p>

<p>I recommend closing this issue with a resolution of "NOT AN ISSUE".</p>

            <p>Bill, the workarounds you suggest would work perfectly, but my idea was to integrate the last solution you provided (get_magic_quotes_gpc) internally within parameters' getters of Zend_Controller_Request_Http (like getParam(), getPost(), etc.) based on value of some member variable ie. autoStripslashes. To hell with magic quotes! ;-)</p>

            <p>So we would implement code for <em>new</em> automagic behavior to compensate for ill-conceived existing automagic behavior?</p>

            <p>Well, You're probably right. As applying stripslashes on all GPC data is annoying, function like fixMagicQuotes would be useful. However, first three solutions work on majority of servers and such feature is unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Such a function should be called {{mundaneQuotes()}}.  :-)</p>

            <p>I see your point, too many automagic conversions definitely isn't a good thing. I have managed to disable magic quotes on the server which inspired me to propose this idea of auto-stripslashing so I agree it's unnecessary :-)</p>
