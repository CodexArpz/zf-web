    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The done flag is never being changed to 1. I verified the code and it seems it's only done for the branch using the fileprogress extension.</p>

<p>I could fix it locally. (see patch)</p>

<p>The same fix can be done as a workaround by making the same verification after the call. Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http::getProgress( $id );
$upload['done'] = $upload['total'] == $upload['current'];</p>

<p>However, I am wondering is this change to done should not be made as part of receive() instead.</p>

            <p>I can not verify this behaviour.</p>

<p>For APC the key "done" is part of the return value from apc_fetch.
It is part of APC's upload cache. See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.rfc1867">http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦</a> for details.</p>

<p>When you are not getting this return value within your environment then there is something completly wrong.</p>

<p>For the fileupload extension we simulate this key, therefor it is set explicitly for this extension.</p>

            <p>I don't know what the expected behavior is, but I can confirm that using APC 3.1.3pl1, 'done' is not being set to 1.</p>

<p>The initial sample of the feature by Rasmus sets the flag manually.

            <p>Reading the example you gave from Rasmus the "done" key is NOT set manually.</p>

<p>Wether while the upload is in progress, nor when it has been finished the key is set manually.</p>

<p>When in your beta-release of APC, the done key is not set you can not rely on it. Note that within default PHP installations (where APC is delivered) there is no problem.</p>

            <p>I made additional tests. The issue is not present when using APC 3.0.19.</p>
