    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When creating a file element in a sub form the name attribute should use the array notation in this form: sub_form[element_name] but this work.</p>

<p>I have the following two elements in a sub form:
$image_src = new Zend_Form_Element_File ('image_src');
$this-&gt;addElement($image_src);</p>

<p>$image_alt = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('image_alt');
$this-&gt;addElement($image_alt);</p>

<p>The elements as rendered in the sub form look like this:

            <p>@G.:
I just verified but I can't get your results.
When I name the file element "image_src" the rendered element is also named "image_src" and not "image".</p>

<p>Related to the sub_form notation:
This is nothing which can be done for file elements.</p>

<p>The problem arises when you use Sub-Sub-Forms, or deeper nesting, or when you use multifiles with Sub-Forms. PHP then brakes the Sub-Form notation into something unreadable.
For example a file within a 3 level nested Sub-Form would be named "subform3[subform2][subform1][subform0][image_src]".
But the resulting $_FILES array is
Array ([subform3] =&gt; Array ([name] =&gt; Array ([subform2] =&gt; Array ([subform1] =&gt; Array ([subform0] =&gt; Array ([image_src] =&gt; filename))))
As the resulting name is broken in multiple sub arrays the upload is broken.</p>

<p>This is within PHP itself a not defined behaviour. And this behaviour is different depending on the used PHP version. Therefor we change the naming of file elements to match the accepted PHP naming notation.</p>

<p>With the actual PHP releases there is no known solution to this problem as it's simply not defined.</p>

<p>This is not a bug, this is wished behaviour and I think it's also documented.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding so quickly.</p>

<p>The first "issue" is my own fault as I was trying to simplify the code for this report and got it wrong. I do get image_src as the element name.</p>

<p>The issue I was addressing is that I am expecting the file element to be name "image_form['image_src]" (if my sub form is named image_form) and for it to be part of the sub form array when I request the form data when I process it.  This is (simplified again) what I am expecting:</p>

<p>$form_data = $this-&gt;_request-&gt;getPost();
$image_data = $form_data['image_form'];</p>

<p>but $image_form does not contain the data (file name) from the file element, so what I have to do ($main_form is my main form):
$image_form = $main_form-&gt;getSubForm('image_form');
$image_data = $image_form-&gt;getValues();</p>

<p>I only have one sub form to main form (I'm not so ambitious as to have sub forms nested in sub forms).</p>

<p>Obviously, it's not a big deal and the workaround doesn't require a lot of work, but I still think it is a bug as I was expecting it to behave in the same way as other sub form elements but it and I think the idea of array notation is very useful, but not if the file element is missing from it.</p>

<p>If it's impossible for the file element to be added to the array notation in sub forms then I think the documentation (<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.advanced.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a>) should be changed to reflect that.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your time.</p>

<p>Golan.</p>
