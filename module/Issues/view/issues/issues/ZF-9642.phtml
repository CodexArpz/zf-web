<p>i.e right up where the path is allowed
In this instance, the public_dir is set up as '/var/www/vhosts/fairfax.org.uk/httpdocs/pagecache' for 'Static' backend and open_basedir is set for '/var/www/vhosts/fairfax.org.uk/httpdocs' as you can see in the error messages.</p>

<p>The problem is in the _createDirectoriesFor() method which is trying to create all the way back from root even though it is unlikely that would ever be in an open basedir.</p>

<p>Suggestions:
quick fix: suppress errors
longer term fix:
Check if open_basedir restriction is in effect and then try a match to allowed paths, using a matched one as a starting point for directory creation if found.</p>
