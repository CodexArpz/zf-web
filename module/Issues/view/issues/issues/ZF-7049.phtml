    <div class="body">
        <p>Not sure if this is a bug, new feature or improvement...</p>

<p>I have come across an incompatibility that the Soap Server has with the .NET Soap Client. When loading a WSDL generated by Zend_Soap_Autodiscover as a Web Reference in Visual Studio, if there are no objects/complex types in the WSDL signature, then that WSDL is not loaded successfully. I found that the problem is when "types" tag and "xsd:schema" tag, inside that, is missing from the WSDL. It must be there and empty at the least:</p>

<p></p>

<p>I found that putting a call to $this-&gt;addSchemaTypeSection(); in the Zend_Soap_Wsdl::__construct() fixed this.</p>

<p>Is this seen as a bug in Visual Studio or is it a shortcoming of Zend_Soap_Autodiscover and Zend_Soap_Wsdl? And either way should there
not be a work around to ensure compatibility with .NET?</p>

<p>In our company we have to be sure that our web services are consumable (and easy to use) by .NET clients. For now my work around will be to have a dummy method that has an object as a parameter, though this is not optimal.</p>
