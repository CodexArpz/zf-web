    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>If one has a form with a file upload element which is set to not required. The $_FILES will be empty on POST. However $content( = $_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH']) will be larger than 0. The 'workaround' is activated and there will be an error station that the file has exceeded the ini size.</p>

<p>As I understand it this  workaround is in place to detect file uploads larger than the php.ini's max_post_size, php will give in that situation an empty $_FILES.</p>

<p>If this is the reason I would suggest the following change:  if (empty($this-&gt;_files) &amp;&amp; ($content &gt; ini_get('post_max_size')))</p>

<p>But maybe I'm overlooking something....</p>

<p>The code:
// Workaround for a PHP error returning empty $_FILES when form data exceeds php settings</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    if (empty($this-&gt;_files) &amp;&amp; ($content &gt; 0)) {
        if (is_array($files)) {
            $files = current($files);
        }

        $temp = array($files =&gt; array(
            'name'  =&gt; $files,
            'error' =&gt; 1));
        $validator = $this-&gt;_validators['Zend_Validate_File_Upload'];
        $validator-&gt;setFiles($temp)
                  -&gt;isValid($files, null);
        $this-&gt;_messages += $validator-&gt;getMessages();
        return false;
    }
</code></pre>

Can you give an code example which shows your problem?</p>

            <p>Using a file element which is not set to required does not raise an failure within the tests as mentioned by the reporter of this issue</p>

<p>As there is additionally no response this issue is closed as non-issue</p>

            <p>I'm sorry that I was too slow to reply. The problem is that my code is not easily to paste here. So I decided yesterday to further investigate the problem, Before getting back to you.</p>

<p>I use jquery.form to submit. I discovered yesterday that if one has an empty upload field, jquery form will not post the form as multipart/form-data, but as application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If the upload field is not empty it will post as multipart/form-data.
The strange thing is that zend does not throw an exception stating that a multipart post was expected, but throws the error 'File ... has exceeded defined ini size'. Maybe zend cannot detect this?!</p>

<p>The sollution is to set jquery.form to use an iframe. I think other people will run in to this, so hopefully this issue is still usefull to others.</p>

<p>My apology's for waisting your time. Thanks for the help.</p>
