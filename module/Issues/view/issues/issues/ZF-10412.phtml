    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Many of developers rely on formats like json to do stuff like small bits of application logic and object definitions.</p>

<p>Personally, I use json a lot, and my json files get really long and complex. That's why I think it would be nice if I could include some comments in my json strings. But the problem is, the decoder is unable to strip these comments out and fails to decode the string. And that makes working with complex json strings difficult and unsuitable for big projects.</p>

<p>So maybe having an option to tell Zend_Json_Decode to allow comments in the strings would be a big time server for people who heavily use json (instead of xml) in their projects.</p>

            <p>Hey Aria.</p>

<p>There is one fundamental problem with your idea. <em>Comments are not allowed</em> 
inside JSON data, as defined by JSON standard (<a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org/</a>).</p>

<p>This means if Json_Decode read/manipulated comments, it wouldn't be JSON 
anymore and it wouldn't be named Json_Decode.</p>

<p>Here is a discussion on JSON and comments in JSON (with some workarounds)
