    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Filter_Word_UnderscoreToCamelCase can't handle numbers.  Given the string 'address_1', the filter will output 'Address_1'.  I don't know if this was done intentionally, but if not, it is a bug.  I personally don't see why numbers would be omitted.</p>

            <p>For the record, this applies to Zend_Filter_Word_SeparatorToCamelCase,  which is the base class of Zend_Filter_Word_UnderscoreToCamelCase.</p>

            <p>The coding standard say:
"Numbers are permitted in class names but are discouraged"</p>

<p>This is the reason why this filter does not allow classnames beginning with numbers.</p>

<p>Feel free to extend this filter with a own one when you are in need of a classname beginning with a number.</p>

            <p>The use of this filter extends much beyond anything to do with class names.  The intended functionality is to take a string, any string, and return a camel cased version of that string.  Using a number in a string is perfectly valid.</p>

            <p>The "intended" functionality is it's usage within Zend_Controller to convert given classnames to directory and reverse. This is the reason why this filters are actually not documented.</p>

<p>Second reason I closed this issue as won't fix: This is a "word" filter... 1 is no word as words begin always with a alphabetical character. When you give 2 words then both words have to be words and not integers.
"adress" is a word but "1" is no word. By using Word_UnderscoreToCamelCase you said... " I have a string which consists of multiple words which are concated with a underscore char.... please seperate them erase the underscort and make them CamelCase.</p>

            <p>Got it.  I didn't take the use of the term "word" so literally as it reduces the flexibility of working with strings.  Also, this class can turn the string "aaa_aaa" into "AaaAaa", and "aaa" is not a word.  Maybe the class should be called Zend_Filter_Alpha_SeparatorToCamelCase or Zend_Filter_ControllerClassName_SeparatorToCamelCase.  I'll just go ahead and use my own regex.  Thanks.</p>
