        <div class="body">
            <p>As for now, the code coverage report is not very well filled out.</p>

<p>There are several problems as "closing tags marked unused" or "function headers marked unused".
These issues are known and will maybe worked around in future version of PHPunit.</p>

<p>A cverage of 100% is for now not possible.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the report - for now, I'll mark the issue as unscheduled so that it does not become a blocker for 0.2.0.</p>
