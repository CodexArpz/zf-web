    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Dojo 1.3, as shipped w/ ZF 1.8, still has the util directory from dojo 1.2.3.  This directory should contain the new shrinksafe but contains the old broken version with the custom_rhino.jar and customer_rhino.diff.</p>

            <p>Actually, from dojo.version.toString(), it looks like the version of dojo shipped w/ ZF1.8 is "1.1.0dev (15278)".  I was expecting 1.3.0 from the ZF1.8 release announcement.</p>

            <p>This is an upstream issue; we pinned to <a href="http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/branches/1.3">http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/branches/1.3</a> , so if this is the case, it needs to be reported to the Dojo project.</p>

<p>(As for the version, the version string from dojo.version.toString() on the release tags has never once changed since we started pinning, and we've pinned to three different release branches now. :-/ )</p>

            <p>I hate to say it, but the 1.3 branch, when you pulled it for the full package, was at least 8 months old (older than what shipped w/ 1.7.?) - unless the svn version reported by dojo.version.toString() is inaccurate.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the utils directory shows that somethings wrong.  It's nowhere near what shipped with dojo's packaged 1.3.0.</p>

<p>I'd call this a critical flaw (I spent several very hard hours dealing with issues related to this).  It probably deserves a mini release asap to stop others from spinning their wheels with the same problems I had.</p>

            <p>Raising to critical since it may take ZF developers hours to realize that they can't rely on the shipped dojo libraries.</p>

<p>If dojo.version.toString() reported a revision somewhat near what the dojo packaged 1.3.0 code does, I would have more faith that this is just a problem w/ the utils dir in the pinned branch being out of sync.  But since the reported revision is 8+ months old (and 2,000 commits from the revision 1.3.0 was released at), it would be a stretch to assume any of the code is near what dojo shipped in their packages.</p>

<p>BTW, I'll report this on dojo's trac, but they've already updated their 1.3 branch.</p>

            <p>I am interested in seeing this resolved as well.  I have been hunting for a document which details the version of Dojo released with each respective Zend Framework release.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm not sure where ZF pulls its release of Dojo from, but <a href="http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/branches/1.3/dojo/_base/_loader/bootstrap.js">http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/branches/â€¦</a> accurately reports 1.3.0 as the Dojo version.  I am also seeing that the last changed date for said file was on 2009-02-25.</p>

            <p>As noted on list, the externals are correct -- it appears to be an issue from our packaging tool. I'm looking into it for 1.8.1.</p>

            <p>I identified the issue -- our packaging scripts were hard-coding the externals path. I've fixed the scripts to grab the externals path from the current release branch, which will correct the issue for this release and all future releases.</p>
