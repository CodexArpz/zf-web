    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There are no basic (essential to this class!) methods to get full name, short name and symbol from current instance. Since everything is "private" you cannot even extend the class to add them. Currently, the only way is to use static methods, but you have to provide currency and locale again and all Zend_Locale_Data::getContent are executed again and again.</p>

<p>non-static getShortName(), getFullName() and getSymbol() should be added, but it would break backward compatibility with current release :-(</p>

            <p>We weren't planing to add functunality like that when we were designing the API, but it appears to be important now.
instead of creating new instance methods with weird names to get over this, we will use the old static methods by passing it an instance of your Zend_Currency object as a 1st param.</p>

<p>like this</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

$Dollar = new Zend_Currency('en_US');

// the old way, it still works . will print ج.م.
echo Zend_Currency::getSymbol('ar_EG');

// the new way, you pass it a Zend_Currency instance
echo Zend_Currency::getSymbol($Dollar); //prints $
</code></pre>

<p>the new way saves you from calling Zend_Locale_Data::getContent() again and again..</p>

<p>the new feature added in svn-6553</p>

            <p>That's probably the best way without breaking the backward compatibility and it's the step in right direction, but I'm not huge fan of it. In real-life project you have a currency and you want to display all values in it (for example in online store)... Now if you want to display it like 200.00 USD (using the shortName instead of symbol), you have to:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
when preferred way would be:
</code></pre>

<p>or even better
```</p>

<p>The other problem is that currently you cannot really display 200.00 USD, just 200 USD, because you don't have a way to set precision. Currency is most often displayed with 2-digits precision (like prices), so it's very common use - very hard to do with current version :) I've added setPrecision() and ::setDefaultPrecision() to my extension of the class, maybe that's some kind of solution.</p>

            <p>I was already reworking the whole class.
Now I have to rework my already made changes which have taken two days.</p>

<p>Please ask always before reassigning any issue already assigned to another person.</p>

<p>You should never close a issue where no unit tests and no documentation has been added.
Changes to the API as made here have to be thought of precise !</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>hay Thomas,</p>

<p>sorry, you didn't inform me about the rework of the class so I started fixing the bugs that you didn't mark as 'in progress'. sorry again.</p>

<p>I commited the unit tests with my fix. the code were tested and didn't break the API and I was working on the docs.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>No problem ahmed...</p>

<p>Sorry for being angry. I've worked the whole night until 3am for the new class and saw your comment after a short night. SVN did not send me the changes so there's also a problem with the server.</p>

<p>As solution we came to the following solution:</p>

<ul><li>All internal variables have been changed to be within an array (_options) which is protected.</li>
<li>But without the locale... we have a defined get and set for this one as for all other I18N classes.</li>
<li>Code was internally complete reworked.</li>
<li>The constructor does no longer support script.</li>
<li>The setFormat method has been reworked to accept an options array</li>
<li>Script can be set through the options</li>
<li>A new option 'precision' has been added, standardvalue 2</li>
<li>Completly reworked the testbed</li>
</ul><p>I will commit everything when the code is ready.</p>

<p>Still thinking about the static issue... I want to solve all 3 issues at once.
When you have a idea just come out with it.</p>

<p>PHP should be able to have a static and an instance method of the same name... then we would not have the problem ;-)</p>

            <p>I'm not sure the static methods are needed at all. It's very simple to create an instance and run methods from it. I see no need for the statics, they are pretty confusing (you would really expect them to be not static at all).</p>

            <p>Thomas, good work :) . I'm waiting your commit. and like what Artur said, we can turn (getSymbol, getName and getShortName) into instance methods if it's possible now.</p>

<p>we can call instance methods as static methods, but it raises error only when error_reporting set to E_STRICT.</p>

class me {

    public function go() {

        if( isset($this) ) {

            print '- static';

    }

me::go();

$me = new me() ;

$me-&gt;go();

            <p>I am finished with code and unittests.
Except for the static/instance issue.</p>

<p>I have to write additional documentation (for 1.0.2 -&gt; 1.0.3 changes) before I can commit it to trunk.
I think you can test it in about 2 days.</p>

<p>it seams like you forgot to commit the file

            <p>No, I did not forgot the file...</p>

<p>SVN overwrote my changes with your changeset so all my changes are lost and have been killed by your code.
I only had the luck that I had opened my eclipse since 4 days and I was able to redo all my changes.</p>

<p>See SVN 6600 for the right changeset :-)</p>

            <p>Something's wrong. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>$currency = new Zend_Currency('PLN', 'en_US');
echo $currency-&gt;getSymbol().'<br />';
echo $currency-&gt;getShortName().'<br />';
echo $currency-&gt;getName().'<br />';
Zend_Debug::dump($currency);</code></pre>

<p>It should show all details about PLN currency in English, while it shows details of default en_US currency (USD) in English. It's all because _checkParams() does not default to currency set in constructor (instead it assumes gets default currency for the locale).</p>
