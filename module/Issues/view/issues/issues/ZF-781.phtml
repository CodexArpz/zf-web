    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The loading of data should be taken out of the constructor of the config classes and move to a seperate load method.</p>

<p>This would allow for just in time loading of data.</p>

<p>The load method should only be called for any the data access operations (only loading once).</p>

<p>It will mean a minor refactor with no change to the signatures of the methods so it should not effect any users.</p>

            <p>Though in principle I agree that it would be optimal to only load configuration data on-demand, it is unlikely that applications will benefit to more than a negligible amount from this particular change. This is due in part to the nature of the data Zend_Config presents to the application, but more so because of the cost of loading the configuration file relative to the rest of the application. This is likely to be a case of premature optimization.</p>

<p>In the interest of expediting resolution of this issue, I have marked it "not an issue" until it is demonstrated (hopefully with code) that a common and appropriate use case would benefit significantly from such a change.</p>
