    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The changes made in ZF-204 and released in Zend 0.8 introduced a bug where all queries using database schemas in dot notation will fail.</p>

<p>For example, this query would work fine in 0.7 but produce an error in 0.8:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$select-&gt;from('some_schema.some_table', '*');
</code></pre>

<p>In older versions, where the table would have been represented like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
SELECT FROM some_schema.some_table
</code></pre>

<p>it is now represented like this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
SELECT FROM "some_schema.some_table" some_schema.some_table
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a problem for two reasons. (I am using Postgres, but I'm assuming this will also be problematic with other databases)</p>

<p>Firstly, having dot notation in the alias is not allowed. 
To fix this I extended Zend_Db_Select::_join so that if the table supplied is not an array, it is first converted to an array with the correlation field having periods replaced with underscores.</p>

<p>Secondly, Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract::quoteIdentifier simply adds quotes around the given identifier, which breaks dot notation.
Instead of "some_schema.some_table" it must be "some_schema"."some_table"
To fix this, I extended quoteIdentifier() so that it first splits the identifier on periods, then quotes them and re-joins them.</p>

<p>These fixes are fine for me as a stopgap, but I don't know if they are feasible for you, as I haven't considered the broader implications.</p>

            <p>Ah, I just found this after also reporting the issue on the original ZF-204.
You may want to check out the additional comments I've left there.
Sorry!</p>

            <p>Here is a patch that adds additional behaviour to Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract::quoteIdentifier() to solve the qualified identifiers issues, ie. 'schema.table' or 'table.column' or even 'database.schema.table'!</p>

<p>Individual identifier segments, separated by a dots, are quoted when the $qualified argument is set to true. Example:</p>

<p>$adapter-&gt;quoteIdentifier('schema.table')
returns: "schema.table"</p>

<p>$adapter-&gt;quoteIdentifier('schema.table', true)
returns: "schema"."table"</p>

<p>I've also adapted Zend_Db_Select to use this mode for table names,
and also switched the associative array (tableName =&gt; correlationName)
to (correlationName =&gt; tableName).</p>

<p>(This was originally posted on ZF-204, but that issue was closed, so I thought
it more appropriate to post it here, and explain the patch better)</p>

            <p>This issue is resolved as of revision 3795.</p>

<p>Identifiers that contain a dot (".") character are automatically split on the dot(s), and each piece quoted separately.  Thus identifiers support the "schema"."table" or "table"."column" syntax.</p>

<p>If you have a database design that has table names or column names containing a dot character, this should be a very uncommon case, and it is not recommended.  But you can work around it by using Zend_Db_Expr and quote the identifier yourself.</p>
