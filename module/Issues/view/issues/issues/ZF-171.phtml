            <p>Points of Pain:
* reports of "mail" problems that relate to their underlying sendmail implementation used by PHP's mail() function and Zend_Mail (would be good to test)
* those not using web server rewrite rules sometimes encounter problems (it would be good to collect all environment variables in PHP into a structured report provided by Zend_Environment)
* known bugs in various combinations of xdebug, PHP, and PHP extensions (e.g. some version of gd have memory leaks)
* etc.</p>

<p>At this time, simply having very basic functionality in ZF core library would be quite beneficial and allow the community to help contribute to enhancements (e.g. additional tests).</p>

            <p>We have archived Zend_Environment, so such a component will need to be proposed again. Assigning to myself for now.</p>

            <p>I was keeping this open to collect votes, but we know that we'll need such a component soon regardless of votes and it really should be handled with the proposal process.</p>
