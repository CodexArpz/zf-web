    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I made an index with a custom analyzer, I call it Utf8NumComplex (there's a small modification in tokenization, instead of preg_match('/[\p{L}\p{N}]+/u' at line 90 I wrote preg_match('/[\p{L}]+|[\p{N}]+/u' so that it would index better).</p>

<p>The problem is this: for an indexed keyword, for example "e-commerce", a fuzzy search for the word without dash "ecommerce~" returns 0 hits.
However, if I search with Luke, the keyword is found. What's the problem ? The similarity algorithms look the same to me. Am I missing something?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Fuzzy query uses non-fuzzy prefix for searching matched terms. Default prefix length is 3 (the same as in Lucene 2.3, if I'm correct).</p>

<p>It's used to increase search speed (terms dictionary scanning for 'eco*' is much faster than full terms dictionary scan).</p>

<p>Another prefix length (including '0') can be set using Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Fuzzy::setDefaultPrefixLength($newPrefixLength) call.</p>

<p>Please reopen issue if it doesn't solve a problem.</p>

<p>PS Don't forget to set your analyzer as default before query parsing/searching.</p>

            <p>I have followed your suggestion and modified the DefaultPrefixLength to 0. My string "e-commerce" was indeed found, the "minor" setback was that the search took about {color:red}<em>8 seconds</em>{color} to execute with ZF Lucene while Luke (using Apache Lucene 2.9) took.. {color:red}800 us{color}.</p>

<p>So.. I'm still wondering if there's a wonder algorithm somewhere that makes Apache Lucene so much faster than the PHP one :)</p>

<p>PS My analyzer was set as default when creating the index and when I searched it :). Thanks for the suggestion anyway.
PPS The index format that Luke recognized (the one made by ZF Lucene) is Lucene 2.2</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, I skipped an <em>8</em>..
Apache Lucene 2.9's search took <em>{color:red}8800 us{color}</em> (but that's still 0.0088 seconds).
The search was performed against about 16500 terms.</p>
