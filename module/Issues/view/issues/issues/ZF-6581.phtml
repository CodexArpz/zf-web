    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When I upgraded to Zend 1.8, a new issue arose. The call to inet_pton() in line 62 fails when attempting to validate "localhost". I know the error is suppressed and I can set my error handler to ignore it, but it still seems like it would be a common error to incur. It seems like it would be a better solution to avoid the error entirely since "localhost" should be regarded as valid</p>

            <p>But "localhost" is not a IP adress. It's a hostname.
Your rule would also apply to "yahoo" being "213.44.23.16" for example.</p>

<p>And when I define that localhost should point to another IP adress (which is theoretically possible) then your rule would not match anymore.</p>

<p>I see this problematic. And the generic rule is:
When you want to check a hostname then use Zend_Validate_Hostname and for a IP adress Zend_Validate_Ip.</p>

<p>Hostname can also check IP adresses and you can limit the check to the rules you need.</p>

            <p>I agree with your logic.The issue arose when attempting to send an email. Maybe the issue would be better resolved if the Zend_Mail class (or whichever class eventually calls Zend_Validate_Ip) were to test the value against a regex to determine if it's a hostname or ip address and then validate accordingly.</p>

            <p>Closing as non-issue.</p>

<p>When you still think it's a problem of Zend_Mail, then please add a new issue with some reproducable code and description so maintainers for Zend_Mail can take a look.</p>

<p>Additionally please note that in this case the error-supression is the only possible way to prevent the output of notices by inet_pton.</p>
