    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The userSearch function in Zend_Service_Flickr offers additional query options (min_upload_date, max_upload_date, min_taken_date, max_taken_date) that do not exist in the Flick API method that is called (flickr.people.getPublicPhotos)</p>

<p>It would be better to use flickr.photos.search which does have these query options (and a whole lot more).</p>

            <p>It seems all the specific options listed above are now available.</p>

<p>I am thinking of submitting a new method that implements flickr.photos.search, which includes the ability to search by tags and user_id in the same search. Just submitted my Contributor License Agreement today so hopefully won't take too long.</p>

            <p>Ok, scrap the above comment. It seems tagSearch() already uses flickr.photos.search and also has a user_id option, so the same can be achieved with that.</p>

<p>However, I'd still like to consider adding a search() method that can be used for all general searches, rather than expecting tag(s) as its first parameter.</p>
