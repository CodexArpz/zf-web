    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>The search feature on ZF website. I think is the ugliest part of all the website and totally not functional.</p>

<p>See just a sample from #zftalk:</p>

<p>(11:08:37) alkemann: 
spuun: not if i have to write code in a helper function format. there is no documentation for a "Partial" helper in the api
(11:10:34) spuun: 
alkemann: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.partial">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a>
(11:10:57) 
menak [~mat@dslb-084-058-156-030.pools.arcor-ip.net] entered the room.
(11:12:06) alkemann: 
i see thanks. i did try to search for it
(11:16:58) spuun: 
use google :c</p>

<p>So basically none can actually find useful things using the search facility...</p>

<p>So i suggest to replace the current documentation search (and website search) with something more professional.</p>

<p>I don't have experience with more than Sphinx here, but at least for some normal database records it produces very good results.</p>

            <p>Part of the issue is that with items like "partial", they are typically part of a larger "word" -- "Zend_View_Helper_Partial", "partial()", etc. This makes word stemming quite difficult.</p>

<p>I suspect this will be largely resolved with ZF2 and the move to namespaces. The namespace separator is considered a word-delimiter by Lucene, which will allow for better tokenization of many of the class names.</p>

<p>While I appreciate your suggestion of Sphinx, part of the issue is that we simply have limited hardware resources at our disposal. Zend_Search_Lucene is a good fit for us as it (a) forces us to use ZF functionality and improve upon it, and (b) allows us to use the hardware we do have. Lucene <em>is</em> a professional-grade search -- it is the search index of choice for most Java applications -- but, as noted, there are limitations we have due to the nature of the library we are indexing against. As noted, hopefully we can surpass these limitations in an upcoming iteration of the framework.</p>
