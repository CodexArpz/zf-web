    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When sending mail through SMTP, Transport_Smtp sets "localhost" as default HELO.
It seems that Validate_Hostname does not like that as it is not a "real" DNS hostname.
At least I have an entry in my translation log that says that the message "'%value%' does not match the expected structure for a DNS hostname" could not be found in locale "en".
Because of this log entry I assume that the validator failed and threw the corresponding error - otherwise the Translator would never be called to translate that message, would it?
The email, btw, is sent without any problems.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is a bug in Validate_Hostname or if the default HELO for Transport_Smtp should be changed to something else like "127.0.0.1".
When setting the IP there is no error logged, but it's not only when it's using the default - even when setting "localhost" explicitly in the options the error again occurs, so I think it's a bug in Validate_Hostname.</p>

<p>Tested on SVN checkout from 15.03.2011.

            <p>I've tried to reproduce this behaviour, but with the current trunk I've not been able to do that. Can you still reproduce it? If so, would you please include a small piece of code, so I can reproduce it too?</p>

<p>If this bug still exists, I'm willing to work on it.</p>

            <p>Please excuse this if it has been addressed in another bug, but i think that I have found the issue.</p>

<p>In the the isValid function in  Zend_Validate_Hostname, if the name is not an ip address, ie. 'localhost' rather than '127.0.0.1', then the error message is set to Zend_Validate_Hostname::INVALID_HOSTNAME . If the check against local network name schema passes, then the 'status' variable is set to true. In my case, I have set to $_allow set to Zend_Validate_Hostname::ALLOW_ALL, which , when anded with Zend_Validate_Hostname::ALLOW_LOCAL withh return true. This gives us a case where the hostname is valid , however an error is reported</p>
