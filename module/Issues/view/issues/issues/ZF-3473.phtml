    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Locale_Format seems to not like float numbers starting with 9.</p>

<p>This is because of the following code in Zend/Locale/Format.php (around line 386 in 1.5.2):
{{
        if (strlen($value) != strlen(Zend_Locale_Math::round($value, 0))) {
            if ($options['precision'] === null) {
                $precstr = iconv_substr($value, strlen(Zend_Locale_Math::round($value, 0)) + 1);
            } else {
}}</p>

<p>Unfortunately round(9.72) == 10 which accounts for 2 characters instead of only one, hence the precstr length is only 1 character instead of the two it should have, and the final returned number is missing one charater.</p>

<p>A possible fix would be to not round, but use floor to get the decimal part size.</p>

            <p>This would not work as floor takes in account the locale, Zend_Locale_Math does not as it's locale independent.</p>

<p>So your solution would not work for other locales than english or the one near to english.
Also your solution would only work with positive numbers.</p>

<p>So your attached patch does not solve the problem.</p>

            <p>I wasn't mentioning php floor() function, and indeed my patch doesn't use php floor.
I just modified Zend_Locale_Math::round to not perform the +1 addition in case of a decimal digit &gt; 5, in this case it does a kind of floor.
And it seems to work for negative numbers.</p>

<p>IMHO the only caveats I could find are:
 * I didn't test non-latin locale (but I fail to see why it couldn't work)
 * I didn't implement the disabled bcmath part, hence the automated test would still fail.</p>

            <p>I just looked at the patch, havn't done this before as I just replied related to your comments. ;-)</p>

<p>We should not edit the round function as it's a locale independent version of PHP's round and has to work and behave like it.</p>

<p>So there are 2 ways I see:
Eighter fix the string concentation within Format (which would be what I propose).
Or add a locale independent floor and ceil functions which are then called.</p>

<p>Also to mention... all locale functions must work also with disabled bcmath, and actually do... so a test would show this and to implement the patch we would need the tests also.</p>

<p>If you would be willing to do this, I would implement it into SVN. Otherwise you would have to wait some time for me to have it fixed as I have much other work beside this one for ZF.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help anyway. I appreciate every help.</p>

            <p>I've noticed when bcmath extension is <em>enabled</em> the problem reoccurs.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$number = Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(13547.3678,
                                       array('precision' =&gt; 2,
                                             'locale' =&gt; $locale));
</code></pre>

<p>returns 13547.36 with bcmath enabled. Zend Server 5.0, ZF 1.10.2, PHP 5.2.12, Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but your testcase is not what is described here as failure.
It does not start with "9", but with "1".</p>

<p>Issue will keep resolved.</p>
