    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The resource directory has not been moved from trunk to branch when the 1.10 branch has been created.</p>

<p>But these directories were available within trunk at the time where the branch has been created.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The official 1.10 branch was created in r20291, while the resources were added to trunk in r20352; clearly they were never merged to the 1.10 release branch.</p>

<p>Please do so now, so that they may be released with 1.10.1.</p>

            <p>There should be a unittest that checks for the presence of (at least one of) these files. That would also prevent any such thing from happening again.</p>

I was sure that I did that commit.
But in the same timeframe I had severe issues with SVN... maybe my commit did simply not go through.</p>

<p>@Dolf: Mabe already build some tests. See docu mailing list. But I don't know why he did not commit it.</p>
