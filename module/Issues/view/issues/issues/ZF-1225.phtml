    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Add an option to enable or disable DRI by Zend_Db_Table. Only if it is set "true" the cascading write operations will be done by Zend_Db_Table. So you can switch easily to a non-DRI rdbms.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The option to control this is in the $_referenceMap variable.  Set the 'onUpdate' and 'onDelete' elements to the constant value self::RESTRICT to disable cascading.</p>

<p>I'd be glad to add a paragraph in the docs describing the above more clearly.</p>

<p>Switching RDBMS brands (or switching a MySQL InnoDB table to a MyISAM table) should be a <em>very</em> infrequent change, and would require many other code changes anyway, so changing a single value in the $_referenceMap declaration should be no problem.  In my opinion it's not necessary to implement more code in Zend_Db_Table to handle this situation.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Switching RDMBS brands: ok. (code changes)</p>

<p>Switching InnoDB-&gt;MyISAM: ok. (infrequent)</p>

<p>...but you can use my application with MyISAM, so you need a application based DRI. If there are InnoDB-Tables you can use RDBMS based DRI.</p>

            <p>I do not fully understand what is being asked for here.  Since this issue is 2 years old, I feel comfortable saying that it needs some evaluating by the author to determine if its still an issue.  Many changes have happened since 0.9.2 and if we can identify as still an issue (with more information), we can reopen.</p>
