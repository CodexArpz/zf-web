    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>For the record: This bug is connected to encoded slashes in URLs &amp; I know of the problem / necessity to have {{AllowEncodedSlashes On}} in the Apache configuration.</p>

<p><em>Problem:</em> After an update to Zend version 1.11.1  (from an earlier version, can't remember which ) I noticed that the framework didn't build correct routes and request parameters anymore if there were encoded slashes ("%2F") in one of the URL parameters (what's between 2 "real" slashes /). Requests which worked previously failed suddenly.</p>

<p><em>Fix:</em> Remove (comment) line in Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php:626 (in method {{setPathInfo()}}):</p>

<p>{{// $requestUri = urldecode($requestUri);}}</p>

<p>Haven't noticed any side effects so far. I would appreciate if this change could be implemented in trunk (or other fix for the problem).</p>

            <p>Confirmed this is an issue for me as well.  It seems that a symptom may have been fixed in Zend_Rest_Route <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10964">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10964</a>. The diff here appears to be the most likely solution: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3527">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3527</a>.</p>

<p>My problem specifically is with double decoding plus (+) signs in params but this would be an issue with any similar character which can be decoded twice with two different results (from %2B to a plus sign to a space).</p>

<p>My 2 cents: I suspect that the root cause is Zend_Controller_Request_Http::setPathInfo() line 626: $requestUri = urldecode($requestUri);.  As such, the fix to Zend_Rest_Route would likely need to be rolled back if my suspicion is correct.</p>

            <p>It turns out that this could actually be a triple urldecode issue when Zend_Controller_Router_Route::match() comes into play and the route contains a wildcard.</p>

<p>It works for me with the diff from ZF-3527 and removing the urldecode from line 240 of Zend_Controller_Router_Route</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
//$this-&gt;_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? urldecode($path[$i+1]) : null;
$this-&gt;_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? $path[$i+1] : null;
</code></pre>
