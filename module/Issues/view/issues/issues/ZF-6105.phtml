    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In my ZF application I use an Initializer plugin to perform the application bootstrapping. I believe that this is a common (if not recommended?) way of setting up ones environment.</p>

<p>Therefore, I believe first opportunity to start performing the initialisation is during the routeStartup() hook.</p>

<p>I need to give the front controller a custom dispatcher, and I want to do as soon in the dispatch process as possible - i.e. routeStartup()</p>

<p>Now that should work fine. Except that in Zend_Controller_Front (line 883), a $dispatcher variable is created with a reference to $this-&gt;_dispatcher. Shortly after (line 896), the routeStartup() hook gets called. In my case, this now changes the front controller's dispatcher.</p>

<p>And that should be fine, but unfortunately we still have this $dispatcher variable which we created on line 883, and $dispatcher still contains a reference to the old dispatcher.</p>

<p>This becomes a problem on line 934, when we actually do $dispatcher-&gt;dispatch(), because we dispatch the request using the old dispatcher, and not the new dispatcher which is now referenced by $this-&gt;_dispatcher.</p>

<p>Therefore, my proposed solution is to change line 934 to read:
$this-&gt;getDispatcher()-&gt;dispatch($this-&gt;_request, $this-&gt;_response);</p>

<p>But there may be more to it than that, I don't know :)</p>

<p>This is based on ZF 1.7.7</p>

<p>I think this problem may be similar to ZF-4106 (<a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4106">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4106</a>)</p>
