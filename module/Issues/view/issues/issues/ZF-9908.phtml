    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am working with a truetype font that seems to render correctly when saved as a PDF in Word, Photoshop, Acrobat and using the TCPDF PHP class. Strangely when loaded with the Zend Framework - the letters overlap randomly. It looks like a stange letter spacing issue, have tried embedding the font and numerous other things but nothing seems to work. I am not sure what is different with the font that I am using. But seeing as it seems to work correctly when using other libraries/applications I am assuming this is a Zend issue?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am unable to attach the font due to it being for internal use only. Can I ask if anyone can shed some light on what might be causing this issue? And if necessary I may be able to privately send it to someone for testing.</p>
