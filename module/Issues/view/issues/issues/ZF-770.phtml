            <p>I know this sort of crash, but we were not able to detect where it's related.
There are several scenarios which we have tested:</p>

<ul><li>Run the tests alone "phpunit Zend_LocaleTest"... no known problems on any machine with any test.</li>
<li>Run the tests with PHPUNIT 3.0.1... this brakes somewhere in the locale tests almost every time. Seems to be a problem with this version of phpunit.</li>
<li>Exclude some testbeds... unpredicted behavior... sometimes all tests pass, sometimes with the same configuration the tests kill php. But the tests are always OK.</li>
<li>If we have an testbed with a very huge ammount of tests like Zend_Date the php is killed 50% when running tests and one test fail. If the tests are OK, php is not killed.</li>
</ul><p>There is no difference if the tests are run on windows or linux... myself is using windowsXP as you are doing.</p>

<p>After all... there was already an related issue with PHP brake.... it was solved by installing the latest XDebug and PHPUnit 3.0.0 (not 3.0.1) on the testmachine.</p>

<p>Well...
I am no PHPUnit Guru but in my opinion, if all tests show OK, no code from my testbed or class is executed anymore, so why should my testbed or my class kill php ???</p>

<p>I think this is a special sort of failure which shall be given to sebastian for further investigation.</p>

            <p>Sebastian...
maybe you are able to look what's happening here with phpunit.
Would be a great help if you could investigate this issue.</p>

<p>If you need further informations just get in contact.
Tests were done by
Me, gavin, shreef and bill with different results in the reaction of the testbed. But all tests are always shown as OK and none fails.</p>

            <p>The attached screenshot is useless, sorry.</p>

<p>Please update your Xdebug to the current CVS version which has a couple of segfault fixes. Please try running the tests without Xdebug at all.</p>

<p>Anyways, a segfault in Xdebug (or even in PHP) is neither a Zend Framework nor a PHPUnit issue.</p>

            <p>I know that the screenshot contains no specific diagnostic information.  I included it just to illustrate the symptom of the crash, so everyone knows what I'm talking about.  Other types of errors allow one to cut &amp; paste the text of the errors.  But a Windows segfault pops up that little dialog window so I had to include it as a screenshot.</p>

<p>I got the segfault even when the Xdebug DLL is <em>not</em> loaded -- it's commented out in my php.ini.  If Xdebug is loaded, then "php -v" reports it.  When I have Xdebug commented out, "php -v" does not report it.  When I have Xdebug commented out, the tests run a lot faster, but still crash.</p>

<p>I have also tried increasing the max memory of PHP up to 96M, but it doesn't change the crashing behavior.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will do as you suggest, I will uninstall the Xdebug extension completely and try it again.  Then I will update to the latest Xdebug binary from CVS and try it with and without the Xdebug DLL loaded.</p>

            <p>BTW, bugs.php.net generally lists dozens of bugs that can cause segfaults for any given 90 day period.</p>

            <p>As this issue is not related to Zend_Locale itself it was assigned to Component "Unknown".</p>

<p>With the latest Branch, phpunit 3.0.0 and latest Xdebug I was not able to reproduce this failure anymore.</p>

            <p>Upgrade to Xdebug DLL version 2.0.0RC3-dev resolved this issue.</p>

<p>The unit tests no longer crash.  I can run through all the unit test suites and get a full report of code coverage.</p>

<p>The new dev version of Xdebug DLL is much slower than 2.0.0RC1. but that is another issue and it is clearly the responsibility of Xdebug.</p>

<p>I'm going ahead and closing this issue as "Not an Issue" because it has nothing to do with Zend Framework code or PHPUnit code.</p>

<p>No Xdebug loaded.</p>

<p>Still experiencing crashes during test run.</p>

<p>I can prevent the crash by commenting out the following test:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
If I keep that test, PHP crashes.

Another problem test:
</code></pre>

<p>If I keep the latter test, then PHP does not crash, but it increased CPU utilization to 50%+, and consumed 52,744KB of RAM in the PHP process, and hangs.  The PHP process for phpunit does not exit.  I waited for 5 minutes but it did not change.</p>

            <p>No -- I spoke too soon.  Even with those two test methods commented out, php still crashes after the Locale tests, in a subsequent test suite.  It crashes in the Zend_Gdata suite.</p>

<p>Commenting out the following line in Zend/AllTests.php stops the crashing:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$suite-&gt;addTestSuite('Zend_LocaleTest');
</code></pre>

<p>Further experiment: in Zend/LocaleTest.php, I edited the test testgetHttpCharset(), and edited out the calls to Zend_Locale::getHTTPCharset().  This also stopped the php test process from crashing.</p>

            <p>Fixed (again) in revision 3230.</p>

<p>This is apparently related to a bug in PHP's putenv() function:
