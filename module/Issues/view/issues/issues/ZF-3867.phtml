    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>if a custom view helper is loaded and it contains a camel cased name, the function inside doesn't work anymore. i can't find the cause, but when playing around i noticed strange behaviour of the helper paths since ZF 1.6.0RC1.  my problem occured when using SpotSec's baseUrl helper. in my view, i have the following code:</p>

<p>$this-&gt;addHelperPath('application/views/helpers', 'SpotSec_View_Helper');</p>

<p>when calling $this-&gt;baseUrl() later, it executes the proper file (BaseUrl.php) but isn't going to the public function baseUrl() inside. when I changed SpotSec_View_Helper to Spotsec_View_Helper, it worked again.</p>

            <p>There's not enough information for me try and recreate this. Can you either attach the view helper or link to its public location (e.g., an svn repo where it lives)?</p>

            <p>i'm sorry for not posting the link, but here it is: <a href="http://www.spotsec.com/blog/archive/2007/12/14/zend-framework-baseurl-view-helper/">http://spotsec.com/blog/archive/…</a>
the fact that it works perfectly when changing the name to any word which is 'ucfirst' instead of 'camelcase' gives me the thought that it isn't the view helper itself which is wrong...</p>

            <p>Tested with the provided user class, and it works perfectly as of 1.9.2 (whether it was an issue earlier or not - it works now ;)).</p>
