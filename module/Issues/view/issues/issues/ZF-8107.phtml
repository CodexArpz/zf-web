            <p>Hi, Kazusuke Sasezaki.</p>

<p>I think getAdapter would bring us some benefit.
Do you have any reason why the function should be removed?</p>

<p>I will be happy if you would tell us anything until next minor release.</p>

<p>Because once the function would be released, we must wait next major release for removing funtions.</p>

            <p>Hi, Satoru!</p>

<p>I have 3 reasons at least.</p>

<ol><li>I think Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_* is "internal class"(like as Java's).
Is not connect() under "encapsulation" ?</li>
</ol><pre class="highlight"><code>
$client = new Zend_Http_Client($url);
$client-&gt;getAdapter()-&gt;read(); //Fatal Error!!
</code></pre>

<ol><li>Possibile case.</li>
</ol><pre class="highlight"><code>
//-- common or bootstrap file
$client = new Zend_Http_Client();
$client-&gt;setAdapter('Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Socket');
$client-&gt;setConfig($config = array('timeout' =&gt; 10)); // (Offen,via Zend_Config)


// -- base file
// There is a possibility that someone types code like this. (for special site...
$client-&gt;getAdapter()-&gt;setConfig(array('timeout' =&gt; 1));

// -- execute file
try { 
    $client-&gt;request($url);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // logger...
    log("Error!Error!", $url, $date, $useragnet, $config, $e-&gt;getMessage());
    // If logging is limited without enough length, the exception's message will 
    // not be recorded...
}   

//When the error happens,
//A lot of people will see Config File...(and will grep "client-&gt;setConfig")
</code></pre>

<ol><li>There is no reason more than debugging for getAdapter().
I don't know benefit except debugging.
For example, "getConfig()" , "setUserAgent" and other method will also have great benefits to. 
But current Zend_Http_Client has not these method.</li>
</ol><p>And Unfortunatoly, getter's doc-comment is same as mutator.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in ZF-8027 getAdapter() is useful when debugging.  In my case something was setting the adapter to something unexpected, but without a getAdapter() there was no way to even determine the class/type of the adapter.</p>

<p>getAdapter() is also probably useful when using some of the test adapters.  For example if you need to dynamically modify the next "response" that the adapter will give.</p>

            <p>Hi, Michael.
When debugging.
Is not there a way to use other extended-class?</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
//For example,
class Debug_Http_Client extends Zend_Http_Client
{
    public function getAdapter()
    {
        return $this-&gt;adapter;
    }   
}   

//$client = new Zend_Http_Client($url);
$client = new Debug_Http_Client($url);
$client-&gt;setAdapter(new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Test);
$client-&gt;getAdapter()-&gt;setResponse('test');
</code></pre>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Anyway, current getAdapter() is not correct implemented code against its doc-comment.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    //suggestion code
    public function getAdapter()
    {   
        if (!$this-&gt;adapter instanceof Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Interface)
        {   
            $this-&gt;setAdapter($this-&gt;config['adapter']);
        }
        
        return $this-&gt;adapter;
    }

//and, Modifying in 'request()' would be needed.
</code></pre>

<p>And, this changeset was Committed without testcode.

            <p>I'm not completely sure, but I don't think the getAdapter() should be in the business of creating an adapter if it doesn't already exist.  (One reason: if this is the case, then there's no way to tell whether the adapter is already set.)  I don't think it's necessary to check the type of the adapter since setAdapter() already does this.  (i.e. the return type of getAdapter() will never be a lie, because there's no way to set the adapter to anything other than something that implements Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Interface.)</p>

<p>However, I do think there is a problem arising from the patch in that if getAdapter() exists, all direct reads of $this-&gt;adapter (for example, in Zend_Http_Client's request() method) should be converted into reads of getAdapter() instead.</p>

<p>Regarding reason (1) above, I think the problem that calling methods on the adapter directly can lead to nonsensical results is more a consequence of the somewhat strange way the client uses the adapter rather than a problem that arises because getAdapter() exists.</p>

<p>I don't really understand (2).</p>

<p>Regarding (3), I think there probably should be a getConfig() method as well.</p>

            <p>Oh, and regarding why I can't extend Zend_Http_Client myself, and add a getAdapter() method to that: in my case the client is being built by a call to a factory object that I don't have any control over.</p>

            <p>Michael Stillwell, thank you very much for your comment.</p>

<p>By the enough reason in above comment, I satisfied myself.
So, I want to close this issue.</p>
