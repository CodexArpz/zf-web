    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,
  I'm basically working on Magento that uses the Zend framework. In the version of Magento that uses Zend version 1.5.1, the Indian currency (INR) is correctly displayed as Rs. However, when I moved to a new version of Magento that uses Zend 1.7.2, the currency appears as Rp (instead of Rs.).
While searching for this I came across ZF-6208 wherein there is a note that : 
For the locale en_IN, the currency INR is defined with the currency sign "Rp".
Any help in expediting a fix for this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.</p>

            <p>ZF 1.9 uses latest database from Unicode. See unicode.org/cldr for details.</p>

<p>For the english language the sign for the currency INR is
"₨"... note that this is not a R and a p but one single unicode character which reads ₨.</p>

<p>You should also note that the sign depends ALWAYS on the used language.
For english the sign of IRN is ₨
For kannada the sign of IRN is रु
and so on. It differs for languages and regions.</p>

<p>Still, when you need to have another sign feel free to set the currency string to use manually. Look into the manual for Zend_Currency to see how this can be archived.</p>

<p>Please note additionally that Magento is not part of ZF and will therefor not be supported by us.</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,
   Thanks for the note and the link to unicode.org. The main issue is that the currency sign for the INR is Rs and so I created a bug at the unicode site (bug id 2239). They have apparently fixed it in the latest 1.7.1 release. 
You can see the diff here : <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/bugdiffs.pl?id=2239&amp;ignore_attic=on">http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/bugdiffs.pl/…</a> 
Is there a way to let me know when you will be releasing with 1.7.1? Is that even necessary or can I just use the latest xml files?
Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Cheers
