    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The regular expression which Zend_OpenId_Consumer uses to find the  element in the discovery response currently requires the attribute values in that element to be double-quoted (Zend_OpenId_Consumer, lines 618-626).  This makes sense given the XML underpinnings of most modern HTML, as attribute values in XML are <em>required</em> to be double-quoted.</p>

<p>However, since OpenID can be implemented by anyone on any server, it stands to reason that it might be implemented by developers who are not familiar with this requirement.  A good case in point is the blog I recently started on Wordpress.com.  The OpenID  element used in Wordpress.com blogs single-quotes its attribute values; this behavior does not appear to be modifiable, and it looks like it would affect a lot of users.</p>

<p>I would like to propose modifying the regular expression to allow for single-quoted attribute values, so as to avoid unpleasant login errors in these kinds of situations.</p>
