            <p>This is not a bug. The documentation has been updated in both trunk and release-1.10 branches. However, the online documentation seems not to have been built from this. Since this is a problem on the Zend website, I will close this issue within 24hrs unless there are any objections. Note that Matthew is aware of this - I have no control over the online docs myself.</p>

            <p>I've verified that it was in the release branch prior to the 1.10.7 release. I'm not sure why it's not on the site -- we actually build the manual from the latest release when we deploy a new release. I'll check into it.</p>

            <p>Note that someone once claimed the manual hasn't been rebuilt for a few mini-releases. No idea if true, but hope you figure out how it generated from an old version on this occasion. I have believed it was just a case of me pipping the post with the commit.</p>

            <p>Fixed on the site now, and also in our build tools.</p>
