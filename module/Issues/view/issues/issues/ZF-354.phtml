    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There has been substantial confusion arising from the API change for those who missed the email discusison:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/API-change-in-the-RewriteRouter-tf1943012.html#a5327149">http://nabble.com/API-change-in-the-RewriteRouter-…</a></p>

<p>./library/Zend/Controller/RewriteRouter.php:    public function addRoute($name, Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Interface $
route)</p>

<p>Documentation updates should be made in parallel with API changes for components that have been released in an official preview release of the ZF.</p>

<p>The corresponding file in SVN has not been updated to reflect the API change.

  <p>I have checked in a change today which introduces an API change in RewriteRouter. The primary goal was to allow use of custom created Route objects in the routing process. The current Route implementation is very flexible but it's not perfect so it cannot cover every possible URL scheme.</p>
  
  <p>Additionally you will be able to use different Route objects for particular URLs, so you may use default Route for majority of your URLs and a custom one to cover a special case which can't be used with the default.</p>
  
  <p>The addRoute method signature changes from:</p>
  
  <p>public function addRoute($name, $map, $defaults, $requirements)</p>
  
  <p>to:</p>
  
  <p>public function addRoute($name, Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Interface $route)</p>
  
  <p>It's not as big as you would probably think because constructor of Zend_Controller_Router_Route is very similar to the former addRoute:</p>
  
  <p>public function __construct($route, $defaults = array(), $reqs = array())</p>
  
  <p>So there is a need for only a small change in routes configuration.</p>
  
  <p>Before routes were defined as:</p>
  
  <p>$router-&gt;addRoute('compat',
     ':controller/:action/*',
        array('controller' =&gt; 'index', 'action' =&gt; 'index'));</p>
  
  <p>Now you have to create a Zend_Controller_Router_Route yourself:</p>
  
  <p>$router-&gt;addRoute('compat',
     new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(':controller/:action/*',
        array('controller' =&gt; 'index', 'action' =&gt; 'index')));</p>
  
  <p>I also introduced a convenience method of addRoutes which will accept an array of routes as it's parameter (keys are routes names), so you can also define them this way:</p>
  
  <p>$routes = array();
  $routes['news']    = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('news/:action/:id',
                         array('controller' =&gt; 'news'));
  $routes['archive'] = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('archive/:year/:month',
                         array('controller' =&gt; 'archive', 'action' =&gt; 'show'));</p>
  
  <p>$router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();
  $router-&gt;addRoutes($routes);</p>
  
  <p>The unit tests have been modified accordingly. If you use the RewriteRouter, please test it as soon as possible and if you find any bugs, use the issue tracker.</p>
  
  <p>Any comments as always are welcome.</p>
