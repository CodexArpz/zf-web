        <p>If a date header is not set while assembling the message it needs to be added before sending.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From: KyleMac <a href="mailto:nabble@deletethetrees.com">nabble@deletethetrees.com</a>
Subject: Re: [fw-general] Zend_Mail</p>

<p>I was just looking into this missing date header thing since it caused a few
emails to bounce. From what I can tell, the MTA is under no obligation to
add the date header and in Exim it's considered a "fixup" (or rather, not
doing it is called suppressing fixups). Short story; if your MTA adds it
then it's being kind, if not then it's your fault for not doing it yourself.</p>

<p>Considering the date header is meant to be a requirement, I think that maybe
it deserves at least a mention in the ZF manual, maybe it's own addDate()
method and probably to be added automatically by Zend_Mail.</p>

  <p>Date headers are usually set by the mail transport; if you're not seeing
  one, then your transport isn't putting it in (which is bad behaviour on
  the part of the transport).</p>
  
  <p>Two options: investigate your mail transport and see why it's not
  setting the date header, or set it manually using Zend_Mail's
  addHeader() method:</p>
  
  <p>$mail-&gt;addHeader('Date', date('r'));</p>
  
  <p>What are you using for mail delivery, by the way? You mention SMTP, but
  you don't specify what kind of SMTP server you're using. Others may be
  able to point out additional remedies based on that information.</p>
  
  <p>&lt;/mailing list thread&gt;</p>

<p>From RFC 2822: "[The origination date specifies] the time at which the human or other creator of the message has put the message into its final form, ready for transport."</p>

            <p>Thanks Jordan for the patch. It's added to trunk, with some modifications and should be fully tested (don't have xdebug installed here).</p>
