    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Try leaving a Zend_Form_Element_File with no file value specified (obviously set to not required)</p>

<p>After form validation:
 - receive() method will return true even if no file was specified, should fail gracefully.
 - getValue() will return the leaf directory, should return nothing (empty).
 - getFileName() method will return the directory specified with setDestination, should return nothing (empty).</p>

<p>As it is now, i cannot verify if the user actually left the field empty, because everything tells me that something was set.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>When you set an element as optional, of course receive must return true, because it's not required.
This is expected behaviour. Receive does only return false in case of a failure.
But you defined that it's ok when no file is given, so true is returned.</p>

<p>getValue returns null when no file is given... please update to the latest release.
Or use the isUploaded method to check if a file has been uploaded.</p>

<p>getFileName returns null when no file has been uploaded... please use the latest release.</p>

<p>You can verify if the user has not uploaded a file by:
* Using the isUploaded method
* By setting the element to required... isValid will then fail
* By calling getFileName and it's null
* By calling getFileInfo and the name key is empty and isUploaded is false</p>

<p>As you see there are several ways to get the related information.</p>
