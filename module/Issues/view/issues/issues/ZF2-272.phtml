    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I suggest removing the EventManager dependency from the cache component.  I understand the reasoning behind it, but I also think it could be optional without harming too much.</p>

<p>Use Case:</p>

<p>I'm not using the full stack framework, I'm instead pulling in components from various places.  From what I understand, this is one of the intended uses, and why ZF2 is broken down into more isolated components.</p>

<p>I'm using Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher quite heavily (as a choice).
I'm using Doctrine2, which requires Doctrine\Common\EventManager
I'm wanting to use Zend\Cache, which requires a 3rd event system: Zend\EventManager.</p>

<p>Seeing a third event system is a little much and hard to justify.  In a perfect world, it'd be nice to see it standardized so we could pass the same one around (if there was a standardized EventManagement / Event interface across the community), but I'd be very happy if it just became optional instead.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Adrian</p>

<p>the complete plugin structure is implemented on top of the Zend\EventManager component. It's "currenty" not possible to make it compatible the Synfony's EventDispatcher or Doctrine's EventManager.</p>

<p>But as sayed the plugin system is based on it the adapter interface doesn't depents on it.</p>

<p>That means:
  - you are free to write your own Adapter without the plugin system.
  - the event manager will only be used internally and you can write a proxy redirecting triggered events from the one triggered by Zend\Cache\Storage\Adapter\AbstractAdapter to your used event system.</p>

<p>NOTE: Currently the AdapterOptions and the Capabilities assumes the usage of the EventManager. That will be fixed with <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1098">https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1098</a></p>
