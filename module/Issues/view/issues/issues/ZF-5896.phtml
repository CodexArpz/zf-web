    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This is a fairly large change to the underlying process that we currently have for uploading media entries in Zend_Gdata. The previous process was to construct a Zend_Mime_Message reading the entire binary file to be uploaded into a single string and then passing that around within the class structure. This proved to be very inefficient for video uploads to YouTube, especially when dealing with file sizes that approach 1 gig.</p>

<p>The new functionality creates a Zend_MediaMimeStream object instead and uses a Zend_Gdata_HttpAdapterStreamingProxy for the Zend_Gdata_HttpClient. Most of the complexity is in Zend_MediaMimeStream which creates RFC compliant MIME messages and has a read() method that can be called with an arbitrary buffer size (currently set to 1024b). This way both XML and binary can be read and streamed to the server in increments.</p>

<p>The new functionality has been tested through various unit-tests and functional tests.</p>

<p>Functional tests were run both on Linux and Windows platforms and included:</p>

<ul><li>uploading a &lt; 1mb file to YouTube</li>
<li>uploading a 100mb file to YouTube</li>
<li>uploading a 800mb file to YouTube</li>
</ul><p>Video meta-data included Kanji characters to ensure that potential issues with strings could be discovered.</p>
