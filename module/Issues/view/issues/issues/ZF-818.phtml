    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The request object facilitates and encapsulates access to global variables like $_POST, $_GET etc.</p>

<p>For some reason it does however <em>not</em> support access to the content of the $_FILES variable, which is used when uploading files via a form.</p>

<p>Of course a user can extend the Zend_Controller_Request_Http object to get that functionality, but I believe that in this case it should be part of the framework.</p>

            <p>My personal thought on this is that $_FILES should be wrapped in a Zend_Upload (or similarly named) component. There are many issues, such as MIME types, file size, etc. that are specific to $_FILES and should be encapsulated separately. Additionally, the controller request object's primary purpose is to provide access to the request environment to help with routing issues -- which controller and action to invoke. I cannot think of a situation where $_FILES would (or should) ever help in this decisioning.</p>

<p>I encourage you to create a proposal for Zend_Upload.</p>

            <p>This should be proposed as a separate component, Zend_Upload.</p>
