            <p>Removed line 303 where the _session variable is set back to null.
If this reset is present the own provided namespace will not be used because its overwritten.</p>

            <p>The patch would not work, since the namespace name by default depends on id, so if we generate new id, we have to choose new space. Otherwise, the data would be stored under old id and then it would try to retrieve it from the new id.</p>

<p>Maybe using setSessionClass would help?</p>

            <p>I do not understand why a new captcha gets stored under a new id? There is now advantage by doing this.</p>

<p>SetSessionClass sets another session handler which defaults to Zend_Session_Namespace and i do not want to change it.
SetSession sets a custom session which by default always is set to null by the generate method, this means that setSession has no right to exist then :)</p>

            <p>Captcha data is stored under its ID because there can be a number of captcha instances in the same session and the only way for each of them to have its own space is to have the space name include the ID.</p>

<p>setSession is useful for the other part of the trip - when you validate the captcha, however right now I agree it's not very useful when creating it. So far I don't see good solution for it, but I'll think more about it. The problem is the conflicting requirement of session being identifiable by the ID (and different IDs having different sessions) and for session to be user-settable.</p>

<p>BTW, why you need to set session for it?</p>

            <p>Closing due to lack of response, and also due to Stas's comments which indicate why this is a non-issue.</p>
