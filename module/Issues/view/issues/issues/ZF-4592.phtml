    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Because I have always been testing on my personal laptop with xammp.
I now notice my hosting doesn't have all the needed extensions plus php version.</p>

<p>Maybe creating a php file that scans info like the one you get with phpinfo() and tells you what is needed to get things working would be handy for some people.</p>

<p>You can then easily send a list (the one you get on the screen) to your providers support channel.</p>

            <p>Could also be handy if you have made a project for a customer and you are not sure the hosting of the customer has everything that is needed for the project to run.
You could then run this on the customers hosting or let the customer himself run it.</p>

<p>You could use this also before upgrading a your library directory. 
if current version is 1.6 and you want to update to 1.7 but 1.7 has other requirements you could make the script scan if the hosting has the needed requirements.</p>

            <p>I had a similar issue recently and would be willing to contribute this code (it's fairly trivial anyways):

            <p>This code does what I proposed.</p>

<p>Green are requirements that are met.</p>

<p>Orange is when PHP version is good enough but not great.
Orange are extensions that can be mist because there is a software implementation</p>

<p>Red is when requirements are not met.</p>

            <p>Matthew, is this something that we should ship with ZF or make available somewhere on the site? If yes, how is Brad's implementation?</p>
