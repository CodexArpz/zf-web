    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It would be nice to have a convenience method to loads a class, given the class base name, and a list of namespace prefixes. This kind of functionality is already used in Zend_View to load view helpers and filters, and in Zend_Filter_Input to load filter and validator classes. I also needed this functionality in a class I was writing. So, to keep from re-inventing this wheel over and over, it seems like a good idea to just go ahead and add it to Zend_Loader.</p>

<p>The attached patch file has a sample implementation that I've been using, which seems to work fairly well. I'm not married to the method name; change it as appropriate. The key points of this method to preserve:
 * Takes a class "base name" and a list of namespace class prefixes
 * Returns the full name of the first matching class
 * Does <em>not</em> instantiate the class, only loads/defines it (the calling code uses the returned name for instantiation)</p>

<p>Incidentally, this may help with ZF-1675.</p>

            <p>I took a look at this proposed method, and tried to use it in both Zend_Db::factory() and Zend_Filter_Input::_getFilterOrValidator().  This idea needs to be explored more fully with respect to these use cases.  There is no solution to declare the superclass or interface that the loaded class must implement.</p>

<p>This idea needs to be proposed in our proposal process, and show use cases and how the solution can be used to satisfy those use cases.</p>

            <p>I was unsure whether I needed to do a proposal for this. That's cleared up now. :) The patch was just quickly thrown together, to illustrate the idea; I'm not too surprised it didn't work outside my specific use case. :)</p>
