    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, partial views are the only way to render a view in another module, but since the seperate scope is not always required, and the new View object eats some performance (I ended up with 800ms render time in one of my projects), there is another way required. I've spoken with Matthew about this issue yet, We came to the conclusion, that there are several ways to approach this:</p>

<p>a) A View-Helper called renderModule($module, $view);
b) A renderModule() method within Zend_View
c) Extending render() to allow $module as last argument.</p>

<p>I've tested the first method, and it was not possible, because I need access to the internal Zend_View data, so this way is a dead-end. Left are b) and c). I personally would prefer c) over b), as renderModule() sounds a bit weird, So I'm going to write a patch and let it review by Matthew, before comitting it to trunk.</p>

            <p>I don't like the patch. First, it is incompatible with Zend_View_Interface, and second, I still think this can be done as a helper.</p>

<p>To do so, you could call getHelperPaths(), getScriptPaths(), and getFilterPaths() to get the original paths; then use addBasePath() to add the requested module path; when rendering is complete, re-set the paths to the originals, using the set*() variants of the methods listed.</p>

<p>Please contact me if you need help in writing this helper.</p>

            <p>Alright, I don't know why the get- and set- methods didn't show up on auto completion, now wonder that I didn't see them. However, here's the functionallity as view helper now.</p>

            <p>I've looked at the performance of this, and unfortunately cannot offer a solution to make it faster via refactoring.</p>

<p>I tried the following approaches:</p>

<ul><li>Simply stashing the view variables and script paths, clearing the view variables, and then resetting from the stashes following the operation (no reverting of paths or stashing of other settings). This was many orders of magnitude slower because the helper/filter/script paths grew incrementally, making path resolution slower (partial() is last on path). This was approximately 34% more overhead.</li>
<li>Stashing the original plugin loaders and script paths, passing in cloned plugin loaders, and restoring loaders following the operation. This was also slower, for no discernable reason. (34% more overhead)</li>
<li>Stashing the view variables and each set of plugin/script paths, and restoring following the operation. This was slow due to the amount of time necessary to re-add the paths to the view object following the operation.  (approximately 40% more overhead)</li>
</ul><p>That said, if there are actually helpers on each module view path, you can speed up some of this by using the PluginLoader include file cache, though it would be at best a micro-optimization.</p>

            <p>The attached patch is a non-viable solution as it does not reset helper, filter,
and script paths to their original state. This can cause issues with resolution
of these items, leading to unexpected results.</p>

<p>Additionally, in doing profiling of potential solutions to the performance issues cited, there's no reasonable way to improve performance at this time.</p>
