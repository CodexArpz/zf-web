    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently every instantiation of a Zend_Db_Table class (or extension of the class) performs a describeTable() to discover metadata details of the table.  This is probably inefficient, because it must perform a round-trip to the RDBMS to query the schema.</p>

<p>This is a feature request to do some more efficient caching of metadata in the Zend_Db_Table class.  Here are some ideas:</p>

<p>I would propose that in Zend_Db_Table::_setup(), we store the $_cols as a static class variable, not an instance variable.  On the first invocation to _setup(), we'd query the database adapter through the describeTable() method.  On subsequent invocations, the class variable would already be populated and the describeTable() can be skipped.</p>

<p>It is assumed that tables do not change structure frequently (at least in production) and that it would not be unreasonable to treat the static class variable as current.</p>

<p>We can also optionally use Zend_Cache to further eliminate the need for a describeTable() on every PHP request, assuming that reading cached data is more efficient than fetching a table DESCRIBE from the RDBMS.  Probably we should make it an option to set a Zend_Cache object for all classes extending Zend_Db_Table.  That way during development when the schema may be changing more frequently, the cache object can be disabled or at least customized with a very low expiration time.</p>

            <p>Another thought:</p>

<p>Are class variables saved when the object is serialized?
One of the proposals we've had is to allow rows and rowsets to be serialized.
Maybe this is a good reason to keep $_cols as an instance variable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps the metadata cache should <em>not</em> be serialized, because we're reasonably certain that the cache expiration threshold would have passed by the time we unserialize the row/rowset.  So should we always refresh the metadata information when we unserialize?</p>

            <p>Implementation ideas:</p>

<ul><li>In Zend_Db_Table_Abstract, add a class variable $_metadataCache, which is of type Zend_Cache_Core.  This is initialized to null in the class definition.  The cache can be set with a setMetadataCache() method, or the 'metadataCache' element of the options array in the constructor.  Setting this in the class definition is not supported.</li>
<li>In Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::_setupMetadata(), before calling describeTable(), check if the $_metadataCache is non-null and contains a key corresponding to the table (use the physical SQL table name for this).  If so, and the cache entry is not expired, use that cache entry to populate the class variable $_metadata, instead of calling describeTable().</li>
<li>The content to store in the cache entry is simply the array of information returned by describeTable().  Everyone else ($_table, $_primary, etc.) is inexpensive to reconstruct in the Table class, since it does not require a round-trip to the RDBMS.</li>
<li>If we did call describeTable(), and the $_metadataCache is set to a non-null object, save the metadata in the cache, under a key corresponding to the table.</li>
<li>Also support a default cache.  Like the default database adapter that is set as a static property of the Zend_Db_Table_Abstract class, the default cache serves as a default object, so if the table's $_metadataCache object is null, also check the abstract class's $_defaultMetadataCache static property, and use that.  So the abstract class needs static methods setDefaultMetadataCache() and getDefaultMetadataCache().</li>
</ul>
