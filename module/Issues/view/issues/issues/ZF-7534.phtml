    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am trying to setup a listener for messages send to an ActiveMq Broker from Zend_Queue. My client code in the listener class looks like this</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
while (1)
      {
                          
                  if ($messages=$this-&gt;queue-&gt;receive(1))
                  {
                        foreach ($messages as $message)
                        {
                              if (($msg=$message-&gt;body) != null)
                              {
                                    //do my processing and then delete the message from queue
                                    $this-&gt;queue-&gt;deleteMessage($message);
                              }
                        }
                  }
                        
      }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is with the following code in the ZF Supplied ActiveMQ Adapter (happens around lines 208)</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
   // signal that we are reading
        if ($this-&gt;isConnected == 0)
        {
        $frame = $this-&gt;_client-&gt;createFrame();
        $frame-&gt;setCommand('SUBSCRIBE');
        $frame-&gt;setHeader('destination', $queue-&gt;getName());
        $frame-&gt;setHeader('ack','client');
        $this-&gt;_client-&gt;send($frame);
        $this-&gt;isConnected = 1;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>When running in a listening mode , this code creates multiple consumers for every call to receive even though there are no messages on the queue. A better way would have been to strip this code from receive into a seperate method (something like checkmessage or getMessageCount..) and call that before calling receive? Also, it would be nice to have a generic listener in the framework itself that just needs the name of a queue/topic and possibly a polling interval and which can invoke predefined code when it receives a message. Thats how most adapters in EAI systems work.</p>

<p>Again, for now I have written my own adapter that works around this. The documentation on this functionality is sparse so raising an Issue just in case I might have missed something.</p>

            <p>I checked around, but there is no method to obtain the number of messages in the queue.  If you know of such a method for ActiveMQ please let me know.</p>

            <p>The proposed fix will stop the adapter from creating multiple consumers. Instead of hardcoding the value of isConnected, keeping it configurable will give a user the option to have a set number of consumers depending upon expected load and application specificity.</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>

<p>A simple way would be to check that there is a valid MESSAGE frame on a target queue before receive (in its current incarnation) is called. I believe this can be easily done in the _canRead() method?( i may be wrong but the brief look I had at its code seemed to suggest that as the ideal place for such logic)</p>

<p>Using this and my proposed fix would  a) make the adapter create a subscriber on demand  and b) let the user control the number of  required consumers based on his application needs (my current application suffices 1 consumer as i use the queue to process sparse email sending for comments placed on my message board. In another application though I have over 100 messages per sec flowing into the broker so I would like to have more consumers)</p>

<p>This would be a great load balancing act .</p>

            <p>The only method I have found to get the number of pending messages (along with other items) is:</p>

<h1>Activate the ActiveMQ.Agent topic (and JMX)</h1>

<h1>Send a "query -QQueue=" message</h1>

<h2><em>Required</em>: Set a reply-to header with a queue or topic</h2>

<h1>Parse the number from the response</h1>

<p>You might be able to return only the line or number of messages with more options to the command but I haven't tried.</p>
