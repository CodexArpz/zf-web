            <p>Thanks to you, Thomas.
But SVN 5464 doesn't fix the issue of Zend_Translate_Adapter::translate(), that is identica,l but only Zend_Translate_Adapter::isTranslated().</p>

<p>I have one question: Why Zend_Translate_Adapter name doesn't follow the zend coding standard? Its name should be Zend_Translate_Adapter_Abstract. Is it correct? Maybe an issue?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>No...
The class name is Zend_Translate_Adapter... abstract is only the type of class not the name...
The naming follows the coding standard.</p>

<p>This naming scheme is also used by Zend_Memory or Zend_Pdf for example.</p>

            <p>Yes, Zend_Memory and Zend_Pdf have not the abstract suffix but this is not a valid reson to consider this way a good way.</p>

<p>Please, try this test:</p>

<p>What do you think "Zend_Pdf_Element" is?
Abstract.</p>

<p>And what about "Zend_Pdf_FileParser"?
Abstract too.</p>

<p>And "Zend_Pdf_Page"?
Class.</p>

<p>And "Zend_Pdf_Parser"?
Class too.</p>

<p>And "Zend_Pdf_Font"?
Abstract again.</p>

<p>And "Zend_Pdf_Style"?
Class again.</p>

<p>And "Zend_Pdf_Filter"?
...
INTERFACE.</p>

<p>;)</p>

<p>What a mess.
This is not a good convention. I see no convention here.</p>

<p>Zend_Pdf_Element_Abstract
Zend_Pdf_Filter_Interface 
Zend_Pdf_Page
can be considered a convention, a good convention.</p>

<p>The situation is just a bit better with Zend_Memory.
Zend_Memory_Container_Interface is an Interface
VERY WELL!
Zend_Memory_Container is an Abstract class
ARGHHH!</p>

<p>Zend_Db_Table was an abstract class and is deprecated since 0.9. Now its name is Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.
Another example of good implementation is the abstract class Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract.
Zend_Db_Table_Abstract, Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract, Zend_Translate_Adapter are all "Adapter pattern" implementation. Why a different name convention?</p>

<p>I know we are near the 1.0.GA but we can't have a bad name convention that became unchangeble throughout the 1.* release. The change of name is hidden to the user and there is no break of compatibility with old revision.
This is the moment to fix it. There is no reason to have this bad nomenclature.
We aren't discussing if Zend_Translate has to change in Zend_Translator, but what should be the name of all Abstract class and Interface.
This is not a stupid cavil, but a matter of clearness.</p>

Yes, but I want a good standard.</p>

Interfaces</p>

<p>Interface classes must follow the same conventions as other classes (see above), but must end with "_Interface", such as in these examples:
Zend_Log_Adapter_Interface 
Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Interface 
{quote}</p>

<p>And what about abstract class?
I can instance a class and for this reason we have no suffix.
I can't instance an interface and for this reason we have the "_Interface" suffix.
I can't instance an abstract class and for this reason we should have the "_Abstract" suffix.
I think that ZendCodingStandard(DRAFT) lacks in this point.</p>

<p>Zend_Pdf_Filter is an interface and its name is wrong. This is not a reason to imitate it. Or not?</p>

Thomas, this issue is your. Why have you renamed Zend_Feed_EntryAbstract in Zend_Feed_Entry_Abstract and not in Zend_Feed_Entry?
I think you have done the right thing. Why not with Zend_Translate_Adapter?</p>

            <p>Daniele, I am not the one you must persuade ;-)</p>

<p>The standard is made by Zend's dev team. Also the issue you mentioned is not my idea... I only did the coding because no one felt to be owner of this one.</p>

<p>And as last thing to mention:
For changing such an ammount of class names it's almost too late. We are 2 weeks before 1.0. Such a change can not be done because of the API freeze. We're actually only bug fixing.</p>

<p>Btw:
Even if I wish to change the naming I am not allowed without the devteam to be aware of it.</p>

<p>Anyway... this ticket is not the right place for such a discussion.
Each ticket should only contain the things related to it self. And this ticket is related to a TMX problem (which is already solved).</p>

<p>I would suggest that you "create an issue with all classes which have the wrong naming scheme"
You suggest to change / adopt the coding standard.
Mail to the dev team about this one.
Mail to the mailing list for getting others aware of this.
When we change such things they should be done consistent for all classes within the framework not only for one class... ZF1228 was also not the only one related to naming scheme.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, You are right.</p>

<p>Forgive me for the nuissance...I'm new of the community.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the tip. I'll follow your suggestion.</p>
