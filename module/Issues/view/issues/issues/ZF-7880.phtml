    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Due to the performance impact, there should be an change/option under MySQL to use MyISAM tables.</p>

<p>In enterprise environments that process thousands of messages at a time, INNODB creates issues in processing overhead as well as backup and consistency issues.</p>

<p>Alternatives can be: stored procedures or adding additional delete statements instead of the foreign key.</p>

<p>I am guessing that there is more MySQL usage with Zend_Framework, than other DB's, so this may be welcome for larger sites with lots of data.</p>

            <p>You can create whatever table structure or table type you'd like by extending the Zend_Queue classes.  Converting the tables to be MyISAM instead of InnoDB should have no impact on the usage of Zend_Queue (I would actually tend to think performance would be worse with MyISAM).  We made some performance improvements in SVN commit # 18420 which should make it into the next minor release, please see if that helps your issue.</p>
