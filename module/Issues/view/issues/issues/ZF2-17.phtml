            <p>I'm postponing this issue. At this point, we are not planning another 1.X release, and, as such, are trying to limit the number of changes in trunk.</p>

<p>Particular to this issue, Dojo 1.6 does things quite differently with regard to dijits, and simply changing the externals to point at the new branch will result in non-working code for developers using dijits.</p>

            <p>Might one be so bold as to interpret the comment above like: "will be included in 2.0 in the nearby future"?
Imho, this would provide a very valid reason to research upgrading to 2.0!</p>

            <p>More likely, not considering inclusion of Dojo 1.6 until 2.0 at the earliest. We won't go GA on 2.0 until late in the year.</p>

            <p>I'm marking this as postponed; we will not make a change prior to ZF2, and if/how we will manage 3rd-party vendors in ZF2 is still to be determined.</p>

            <p>Dojo just released version 1.7 and the roadmap is (according to: <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/dojo-1-7-released">http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/dojo-1-7-released</a> ):</p>

<p>Work on Dojo 1.8 is already underway. Weâ€™re anticipating a 1.8 release in Q1 2012, and 2.0 in mid-late 2012.</p>

<p>Can we expect a formal statement of the ZF development lead in this matter? It shouldnt be necessary to maintain several Dojo versions alongside eachother to be able to keep using ZF.</p>

<p>I dont intend to sound harsh, but at the moment i have no plannable upgradepath for my GUI toolkit because of this, and that is becoming a burden since i very much want (and with newer browsers need) to use the new Dojo featureset.</p>

            <p>I agree, since ZF proudly held the dojo banner for so long, and even had the benefits of building popularity upon it, "if/how we will manage 3rd-party vendors in ZF2" is simply too vague a statement.
It would be nice to at least point at which direction ZF if going, since so many developers followed the tortuous dojo road because of it. I understand working on upgrading dojo on ZF 1.x wouldn't be productive for ZF2. If we can't get 1.7, at least Dojo 1.6 integration would be very good in ZF2.</p>

            <p>I'd just like to add my strong vote for this upgrade. Now that a ZF 1.12 has been announced surely dojo needs to be updated. There are so many new features and bug fixes in Dojo 1.6 / 1.7, but I am reluctanct to upgrade on my own and then to have to rewrite code when ZF does the offical upgrade.</p>

            <p>We'll address dojo and/or other js toolkit usage in post 2.0.X releases, and likely via modules instead of the core framework.</p>
