        <p>Add an default locale which will be used in the case that wether the browser nor the server provides a locale.</p>

<p>In this case the exception would not be thrown and instead the default locale would be used.</p>

            <p>I just come across this issue.
I work on a MacBook Pro and I created a simple Zend_Service_Delicious script.</p>

<p>This issue causes Zend_Service_Delicious to fail when called via shell on my Mac.
I posted all details here ZF-2318.</p>

<p>About this issue I [<a href="http://www.icynorth.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1917&amp;sid=ea9e75a6518fbc41f62e21beea5523ff%7Cfound">http://icynorth.com/forums/viewtopic.php/â€¦</a> a topic] that apparently describes the same problem.
I vote +1 for a default locale setting on detection failure.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but Zend_Service_Delicious has NOTHING to do with Zend_Locale.
You can solve your problem this way:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'it_IT');
$service = new Zend_Service_Delicious();
</code></pre>

<p>In general the problem is that Zend_Service_Delicious does not handle exceptions from Zend_Locale properly.</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>

<p>I know that the <em>specific</em> Zend_Service_Delicious issue has nothing to do with this Zend_Locale issue.
This is why I posted ZF-2318 under the proper Zend_Service_Delicious category.</p>

<p>However, my comment was to point out how executing Zend_Locale under Mac Osx via shell causes</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
setlocale(LC_ALL, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>to return <em>C</em> string instead of a valid locale variable and, in general, it causes Zend_Locale to throw an Exception.
In this specific issue, my comment was a kind of agreement to your 'default locale' suggestion. :)</p>

<p>I also noticed that Zend_Locale autodetection calls this function</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    /**
     * Returns the locale which the framework is set to
     */
    public function getFramework()
    {
        $languages = array();
        return $languages;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but it seems closed to itself without any possibility of adding defaul languages without extending the class itself.
Is it a bug or a design decision? (May be this should be a different issue?)</p>

<p>PS. About Zend_Service_Delicious, I already used setlocale(LC_ALL, 'en_US'); as a workaround before and it works but I think something should be improved in the class itself, this is why I opened a new issue at ZF-2318.</p>

            <p>The getFramework() method was added because when this proposal was made there was a discussion of adding a generic framework wide config.</p>

<p>There is still a proposal which aims to do so... this is what this method was made for.
As the related proposal is still not implemented the method is still empty.</p>

<p>This is no bug, it was a design decision of the dev-team.</p>
