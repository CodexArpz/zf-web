    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I found that adding a day on the last day of the year causes toString to behave inconsistently. This code reproduces the problem:</p>

<p>require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
   date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');</p>

<p>$date = new Zend_Date('2009-12-31 12:00:00', null, 'en_US');
   echo $date-&gt;toString(Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP)."\n";</p>

<p>$date-&gt;add(1, Zend_Date::DAY);</p>

<p>echo $date-&gt;toString(Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP)."\n";
   echo $date."\n";
   echo $date-&gt;toString('YYYY-MM-dd')."\n";</p>

<p>I get this output:</p>

<p>1262278800
   1262365200
   Jan 1, 2010 12:00:00 PM
   2009-01-01</p>

<p>After adding one day, the date has correctly wrapped around to 2010. This is visible in the timestamps and when the string is printed with the default format.  When printed with a different format, however, the year part has not updated.</p>

Note that the default ISO format differs from PHP's format which can be irritating if you have not used in previous. Especially the format specifiers for Year and Minute are often not used in the intended way.</p>

<p>For year there are two specifiers available which are often mistaken. The Y specifier for the ISO year and the y specifier for the real year. The difference is small but significant. Y calculates the ISO year, which is often used for calendar formats. See for example the 31. December 2007. The real year is 2007, but it is the first day of the first week in the week 1 of the year 2008. So, if you are using 'dd.MM.yyyy' you will get '31.December.2007' but if you use 'dd.MM.YYYY' you will get '31.December.2008'. As you see this is no bug but a expected behaviour depending on the used specifiers.</p>

<p>For minute the difference is not so big. ISO uses the specifier m for the minute, unlike PHP which uses i. So if you are getting no minute in your format check if you have used the right specifier.

Why are my dates formatted wrong? Why do I get the false year value?</p>

<p>When using own formats in your code you could come to a situation where you get for example 29.12.2009, but you expected to get 29.12.2008.</p>

<p>There is one year difference: 2009 instead of 2008. You should use the lower cased year constant. See this example:</p>

<p>$date-&gt;toString('dd.MM.yyyy'); 
Note the lower cased "y" which makes the difference and outputs the real year.

            <p>I see. Thank you for your answer, and I'm sorry for being redundant. I have read the Zend_Date documentation in its entirety, but not recently. I think the note you quoted must have failed to register.</p>

<p>I'll just steer clear of the ISO 8601 format from now on, since it seems more gratuitously awkward than I need.</p>

            <p>Zend_Date supports 3 standards.
It's on you which standard you want to use.</p>

<p>You will have the same problem when you are using the GNU standard with false format tokens.</p>
