    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Socket adapter now defaults to sslverifypeer = true which requires sslcapath to be set (default null). If left as default, errors similar to the following occurs:</p>

<p>Unable to Connect to <a>ssl://my.https.site:443</a>. Error #0:</p>

<p>Setting sslcapath to "/etc/ssl/certs" on Ubuntu 12.04 fixes the problem.</p>

<p>Since the path varies on platforms, I believe sslcapath should be required if sslverifypeer is true.</p>

            <p>A few notes:</p>

<ol><li><p>The "error #0" thing comes from OpenSSL / PHP's openssl extension. There's no way to get a better message, at least not after digging into this for quite some time. There's also no way to assume the error is specifically a peer verification error. In short, PHP itself or maybe OpenSSL hides it from us, and there's little we can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The path varies, but on quite a lot of installations it "just works" as the OpenSSL lib linked to PHP knows where to look for certs - at least that's what I've seen several times.</p></li>
</ol><p>My recommendation would be to put a big note in the docs but not change the behavior from what it is now. Unless someone can find a way to get a better error code / message from OpenSSL.</p>

            <p>This happens on a stock Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS with latest Zend Server 5.6.0. It would be nice to know whether this is then caused by Zend Server or Ubuntu, since I'm pretty confident this will bite a lot of people given the platform's popularity.</p>

            <p>It's likely that it's a Zend Server related issue, because it ships with it's own OpenSSL but without any SSL certificates, and doesn't know to locate them at /etc/ssl/certs (as it builds generically for different Linux distros).</p>

<p>I have seen it work on different setups, but I do not know if it works on most of them or not.</p>

            <p>Actually, it seems like ZS uses the system SSL. libphp5.so (and ./configure in php -i output) both seem to link to the system openssl libs. So this is looking more like an Ubuntu issue.</p>
