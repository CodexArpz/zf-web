    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>in Zend Framework 1.6.2 I just included my language files with this line:</p>

<p>$translate = new Zend_Translate( 'tmx', APPLICATION_PATH . '/languages' );</p>

<p>It worked great. Now I just updated my ZF to 1.7 and I get this Notice:</p>

<p>Notice: The language 'de' has to be added before it can be used. in C:\xampp\include\Zend\Translate\Adapter.php on line 296</p>

<p>Also the Framework doesn't translate my Form anymore.</p>

<p>I can avoid this notice by adding the full filename of the tmx-file i.e.:</p>

<p>$translate = new Zend_Translate( 'tmx', APPLICATION_PATH . '/languages/lang.tmx' );</p>

<h2>but I think that's wrong, because of tmx = folder include /  more languages in one file...</h2>

<p>here is a sample code. you can reproduce the notice.</p>

<p><a href="http://nopaste.php-quake.net/108073">http://nopaste.php-quake.net/108073</a></p>

<p>try the code and you get a notice (don't forget to put the tmx code to a tmx file ...)
after that just comment line 21 and uncomment line 23. you'll get no error/notice then...</p>

<p>in the manual is still the text that tmx can link to a directory not just to a single file...</p>

<hr /><p>sorry I just can't find the function to simply add a comment.. :(</p>

<p>it also doesn't work if i rename the dir to:
{quote}
$translate = new Zend_Translate( 'tmx', APPLICATION_PATH . 'languages' );
{quote}
also doesn't work with:
[...]APPLICATION_PATH . '\languages'); nor with [...]APPLICATION_PATH . '\languages'); nor with [...]APPLICATION_PATH . 'languages\'); [.....]</p>

<p>testing on a win32 system.
stacktrace:
{quote}
{main}( )   ..\test.php:0

trigger_error ( 'The language \'en\' has to be added before it can be used.', 1024 )    ..\Adapter.php:296
{quote}</p>

<hr /><p>but im sure that the directory does exists. 
again: 
it works great with zf 1.6.2. without any notices or problems.
i read the migration thing but i couldn't find anything about my problem...</p>

<p>and i delivered the tmx file here... you see that the requested language is available :-(</p>

            <p>Please read the manual... there are migration notes for 1.6 to 1.7.</p>

<p>Also a notice does not prevent the code from being executed. Please read the notice. It describes the problem.</p>

<p>and which of the several languages should be set ?
None in your case as you defined none... so the language from 'auto' is set and this is in your case 'de' which is not available in your tmx files.</p>

            <p>You code can not have worked in 1.6.2 because application wide locales were added with 1.7.</p>

<p>When you don't want warnings why do you not set the 'disableNotices' option to prevent the output of notices ?</p>

            <p>Please do a simple debugging of your own code and look if translation is the problem or your form.</p>

<p>Look which languages are available
Look which translations are available
Look if you can manually translate
Look if the requested language is available
Look if you set the correct parameters
Look into the migrations chapter</p>

            <p>Problem not reproducable.
Probably a forms problem or a missing translation file.</p>

            <p>Editing the original issue is really a very bad behaviour.
This way no one can follow the problem.</p>

<p>Related to your code, all works as expected... there is no problem at all.</p>

<p>But do you really think that what you gave as directory is a directory ?
I would say this is impossible...
According to your example you gave the following directory:</p>

<p>realpath( dirname( <strong>FILE</strong> ) ) . '..\application\/languages'</p>

<p>And my understanding is that a directoryname which is named "\/" is not detected as directory because this is impossible wether in Win* nor in Linux to have a directory with such a name.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Again...</p>

<p>Look which languages are available
Look which translations are available
Look if you can manually translate
Look if the requested language is available
Look if you set the correct parameters
Look into the migrations chapter</p>

<p>You will get this error only when
 * The directory does not exist
 * The language does not exist</p>

<p>And don't say it exists, because with your original code when I changed the directory my php said that the path is no directory.</p>

<p>A simple check with isDir would have shown you this. Zend_File_Transfer does nothing different.. it prooves if the given string is a directory with isDir, else it is treaten as normal filename.</p>

<p>And with getList you can see which languages are available before setting them with setLocale().</p>
