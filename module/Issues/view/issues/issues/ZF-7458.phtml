    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I've been having a problem authenticating using OpenID with the MyOpenID site.</p>

<p>Just as the error in the summary suggests, I have traced the problem to the Zend_OpenId_Consumer-&gt;verify function (line 316). The problem stems from the 'openid_op_endpoint' parameter not matching the stored discovered server.</p>

<p>During initial server discovery, MyOpenID is sending back '<a href="http://www.myopenid.com/server">http://www.myopenid.com/server</a>' and this is stored in the consumer storage file. After authentication with MyOpenID, in the 'openid_op_endpoint'  parameter, it is sending back '<a href="https://www.myopenid.com/server">https://www.myopenid.com/server</a>'. Note that the only difference is the scheme (http vs. https) but this is enough to cause the authentication to fail because it does not match.</p>

<p>I don't know why MyOpenID is sending back two different endpoints and I know this isn't exactly a bug per se but perhaps the code should be changed to verify the endpoint based only upon the host and path.</p>

            <p>I'm looking into this. MyOpenId automatically redirects http to an https endpoint which may not be getting picked up correctly by Zend_Openid.</p>
