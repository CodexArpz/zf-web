    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>With a personal php error trigger, Zend_Validate_Ip sends warning:</p>

<p>line: 62
inet_pton() : Unrecognized address <a href="www.XXX.com">www.XXX.com</a>
Zend/Validate/Ip.php</p>

<p>This class use @ in order to hide this error, but @ doesn't work with a php error trigger.</p>

            <p>First off:
When using a validator you should use the correct one... Zend_Validate_Hostname validates hostnames, and Zend_Validate_Ip only IP adresses.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zend classes must be coded in a strict way.
No error or output is allowed in default installations.</p>

<p>When using a custom error handler you define yourself that you want to get all notices even if they are supressed intentionally.</p>

<p>As for the IP validator... there is no way to support IPv6 within ZF without the usage of inet_pton. We would have to recode inet_pton ourself which is also not allowed.</p>

<p>Feel free to give us a "usable" solution for this problem when you have one.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>In fact, i'm not calling Zend_Validate_Ip onto an host but Zend_Feed_Atom(my_host).
I understand what you tell, but usable solution may be to check into Zend_Feed_Atom validator if an IP or an host was given.
So we may patch Zend_Feed_Atom and not Zend_Validate_Ip.</p>

<p>What do think about this ?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>When you give a issue for Ip with a error from Ip without any additionally information I also expect that you are using Ip and not Feed. :-)</p>

<p>A "usable" solution would be to use Zend_Validate_Hostname because I don't expect that a user gives his feeds ALWAYS as Ip Adress but surely as Hostname Adress. Additionally Hostname does not call Ip when the given input is no Ip  Adress which means that there is no notice thrown.</p>

            <p>Feel free to open a new issue for Zend_Feed.
Additionally I would propose that you test your problem against ZF 1.9PR or SVN trunk to see if it was already fixed in past.</p>
