    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In my app, I want to log the whole SMTP transaction. To do so, I'm using:
{quote}
$tr-&gt;getConnection()-&gt;getLog()
{/quote}</p>

<p>This works and provides me with the SMTP transaction, however.. its length is limited.
Upon further investigation there is an hard coded value MAXIMUM_LOG in Zend_Mail_Protocol_Abstract.</p>

<p>I've (temporarily) modified this from 64 to 4096 so it covers the whole transaction.In my app I remove everything between DATA and the 
trailing .</p>

<p>Can there be a setter (and getter) to modify this limit?</p>

            <p>Maybe its also possible to add an option to disable the limit/checking of the limit.
Setting it to 999999 isn't very pretty.</p>

            <p>I would also love to see a change here because I have the problem that I want to send a mail with attachments &gt;100MB, and my php memory limit of 512 MB is exhausted, I think this log is one of the problems. 
I would like to disable logging completly, setting MAXIMUM_LOG to 0 is not enough because the big DATA request would be logged anyway into $this-&gt;_log and fill up my memory.</p>

            <p>Forget the sentence with the big DATA request, I have seen that there are thousands of little log entries instead of one big log entry when sending a big mail.</p>

<p>But I would like to disable this log per default because 99% of the users don't need it, it only wastes CPU. If a developer needs the log he can enable it then, but default should be off. Or default of $_maximumLog should be -1 which disable the log. In _addLog there has to be one line</p>

if ($this-&gt;_maximumLog &lt; 0) return;

            <p>Resolved on trunk and will be released in the next major release.</p>

<p>Please beware that I'm unsure why originally it was chosen to use a constant for this. If it turns out there was a proper reason for that that's still legit this patch will be reverted.</p>

<p>In any case; thank you for reporting this issues and my apologies for the delays in fixing it.</p>

            <p>I checked your commit, Dolf, and I cannot see a possibility to disable the log. Should I create a new issue for that?</p>

<p>Because I don't want to log the transaction in production environment, and logging every line is a performance problem, because in my tests when sending a 60MB mail I have 300.000 calls of _addLog and also 300.000 calls of</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

Best solution would be to have something like
</code></pre>

<p>// Save request to internal log
if (true == $this-&gt;_loggingEnabled) {
    $this-&gt;_addLog($request . self::EOL);
}```
in both _send() and _receive() so we don't have thousands of function calls.</p>

<p>Perhaps in ZF 2.0 we could even disable this logging feature by default because only developers need it for debugging, 99% of the users don't need that logging feature in a default installation. This would increase the performance of the component. But this would be a BC.</p>

            <p>@Josh: I don't see it, could you please tell me the line? There is no "return" or something in _addLog(), so the function _addLog() is called every time and an entry is filled into the array $this-&gt;_log . You are right that this entry is shifted out on the next call of _addLog(), but it keeps filling the array 300.000 times.</p>
