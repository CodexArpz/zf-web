    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I have created apc cache for Zend_Navigation instance. I have got massive performance improvement on container init.</p>

<p>But still there is a problem on rendering helper.</p>

<p>findActive function of Zend_View_Helper_Navigation_HelperAbstract class is consuming too much time on render.</p>

<p>I think findActive function may use to indexing or caching adapter for following calls.</p>

            <p>Hi Tuğrul,
at this point a caching adapter for Zend_Navigation (ZF1) is not an option.</p>

<p>If you can you give a proposal for implementation, then we can reopen this issue.</p>

            <p>Maybe can pick active node and keep aside on navigation build.</p>

<p>I abandoned ZF1 and look at ZF2. I don't like ZF2 because there is a unnecessary confusion on ZF2.</p>

<p>I'm using Phalcon framework currently and building my own navigation component based on mongodb. I think dbms is very easy and fast way find active node with query and climb up throught parents using dbref.</p>

Give me an example how would you do it.

Confusion? It is new and makes many things diffent, but ZF2 is much more flexible and better structured. The module structur in ZF2 is very nice!
Some practice and maybe a complete project and you will no longer have any big problems.

A db-adapter is not a option for Zend_Navigation in ZF1.</p>

<p>If you can offer a good solution, then I will write a patch and unit tests. But we can't rewrite the whole component.</p>
