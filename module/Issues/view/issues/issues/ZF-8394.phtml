    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When creating an action named foo-bar I would expect the action name in the controller to be camel cased, but instead it keeps the action name as is.</p>

<p>This causes an error with the CLI when you try to create another action on the same controller:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '-', expecting '('</p>

<p>The view scripts are correctly left as is.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>if you think about it from an OO perspective, each action is a method of a class.
so calling index action of index controller calls:
IndexController::indexAction()</p>

<p>if you called an action 'test-action'
then it would call:
IndexController::test-actionAction()</p>

<p>the hyphen character is not a valid method naming character, therefore this is not a bug.
if you want to have hyphenated urls, consider using Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static, or a rewrite rule in your .htaccess</p>

<p>urls initially map to /controllername/actionname</p>

<p>calling ControllernameController::actionnameAction, if Zend_Tool was to camel case the action name then it would have to also create a rewrite rule/static route so you could access the hyphenated action. I think this would be cause Zend_Tool to undertake too much work by having to generate extra code.</p>

            <p>I did not expect the method to be named with the hypen, I expected it to be camel-cased.</p>

<p>So if I called an action test-action in the index controller
it would call IndexController::testActionAction()
not
IndexController::testactionAction()</p>

<p>I understand the use of Routers so I am happy to use them.</p>

<p>However, I feel Zend Tool should block the input of illegal characters.
Ideally this should be done when creating a controller and action.</p>

<p>My other issue is that part camel-cased action names look wrong, but that's just my opinion :)</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

            <p>Can be closed I think. When I try to add a hyphenated action, I get an error message as expected.</p>

<p>zf create action foo-bar user</p>

<p>An Error Has Occurred 
Action names should be camel cased.</p>

            <p>This was fixed with the "canonicalization" of names patch in 1.10 (I am pretty sure that is when that error message came in).</p>
