    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, there is no way to specify additional bind parameters for the where clause of the functions update and delete. This leads to a mess of $adapter-&gt;quoteInto()'s on complex where conditions.</p>

<p>Could the Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract be extended to include an additional optional array parameter which would include the bind parameters for the where clause?</p>

<p>I have had to fork the entire Zend_Db namespace in order to implement this myself, as without this feature, these two helper functions become fairly unusable.</p>

<p>I will try to include a patch file of the changes needed if the tracker will let me.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just noticed my patch has a slight problem in it. The $params array_merge should be typecasted to array as the array_merge will fail on a null parameter.</p>

            <p>I have signed the CLA, and been confirmed.</p>

<p>I've included a patch of the changes from the current trunk (r11898) needed (a bit better written this time), along with added tests for the extra parameters.</p>

<p>I've run the tests using the pdo_mysql and mysqli adapters.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can do to speed up getting this fix into the next minor release?</p>

            <p>If you can't complete this, can you assign it to someone who can? It is a trivial change that should take a miniscule amount of time, especially when I have done the tests which have passed for me. It shouldn't still be incomplete over 6 months after the issue was opened.</p>

            <p>Ok, thanks.</p>

<p>I've had a look through the issue tracker, and there appears to be several duplicate requests, although some requesting a different format:</p>

<p>ZF-3129 - Same request, bind parameters are additional function arguments.
ZF-2863 - Alternative notation of an associative $where array
ZF-651 - Suggests Zend_Db_Table_Abstract update/delete improvements as well</p>

<p>I'll include a patch containing changes to Zend_Db_Table_Abstract as well (they just pass through the bind parameters).</p>

<p>I've made two test cases for that as well. I wasn't sure whether to expand on these tests, as the adapter tests cover them. I wasn't able to see if these tests worked, as for some reason my test setup ignores the tests/Zend/Db/Table/TestCommon.php tests.</p>

            <p>Ok, I just noticed since ZF 1.8, _whereExpr has been updated to allow associative arrays, which the ZF-2863 issue mentions, so I guess I'll have to go with that. Could all these issues be closed as they no longer apply?</p>

            <p>On second thoughts, trying to apply the associative array method of where expression doesn't fit all situations, e.g.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
UPDATE table SET field = "value" WHERE condition1 = "5" OR condition2 = "9"
</code></pre>

<p>There would be no way to do this, as the _whereExpr always joins the conditions with AND.</p>

<p>The way I've suggested will allow for simple quoting into where conditions of any complexity, and conform to the same style as query()</p>

<p>e.g. for the above</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$db-&gt;update('table', array('field' =&gt; 'value'), 'condition1 = ? OR condition2 = ?', array(5,9));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not suggesting removing the _whereExpr associative array, but adding this will allow more advanced updating.</p>

<p>Or ideally maybe something like:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$select = $db-&gt;select()-&gt;where('condition1 = ?, 5)-&gt;orWhere('condition2 = ?', 9);
$db-&gt;update('table', array('field' =&gt; 'value'), $select);
</code></pre>

        <div class="body">
            <p>This has been available for some time now with the following syntax</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$db-&gt;update('table', $data, array('foo  = ?' =&gt; $bar, 'baz = ?' =&gt; $bat));
</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$db-&gt;delete('table', array('foo  = ?' =&gt; $bar, 'baz = ?' =&gt; $bat));
</code></pre>

<p>These bindings can also be used with Zend_Db_Expr</p>

<p>closing as no longer an issue.</p>
