    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,
Today I started to to work with ZF and I followed some tutorial from Pro PHP book.
Unfortunately I made some spelling error, which was really hard to debug.</p>

<p>The problem was I made a one letter misspell in following class:</p>

<p>class Customers extends Zend_Db_Table {
    protected $name = 'customers';
    protected $_primary = 'customer_id';
    protected $_sequence = 'customers_customer_id_seq';
}</p>

<p>The problem was of course:
protected $name = 'customers';</p>

<p>Because of above error I got following Exception:
Zend_Db_Table_Exception: Primary key column(s) (customer_id) are not columns in this table () in /usr/share/php/ZendFramework/ZendFramework-1.8.3/library/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php on line 796</p>

<p>I didn't know why there is no columns for my table.</p>

<p>The problem is, that in my case ZF setted up table name for me: 'Customers' - using class name.
PostgreSQL is case sensitive, so if my table was: 'customers', not 'Customers' - it did not find anything.
Method describeTable() from Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Pgsql class will return empty array.</p>

<p>For me it should check if specified table really exists in database.
It is very easy:</p>

<p>$sql = "SELECT c.relname
FROM pg_class AS c
WHERE c.relname = " . $this-&gt;quote($tableName);</p>

<p>If above query returns no data, it means that there is no such table, so you could raise an exception!
And my advice is to add such exception to method describeTable()</p>

<p>Best regards,
Tomasz Kuter</p>

            <p>It seems as though you are following a faulty tutorial.  Please see the Zend_Db_Table documentation for proper usage.  It appears that protected $name should be protected $_name.  Also, you should not set the $_primary or $_cols members of the class as that information will be setup for you by the Table class during _setup() and _setupPrimaryKey().</p>

<p>If you feel there is still an issue after proper usage, feel free to reopen with more information.</p>
