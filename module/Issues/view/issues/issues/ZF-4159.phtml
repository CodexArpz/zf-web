    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The JSON specification states that object property names must be strings. While this makes sense for converting them to objects it does mean that PHP associative arrays with numeric keys get converted to strings.</p>

<p>This leads to an inaccurate object representation in FirePHP where the original numeric keys are displayed as strings.</p>

<p>There are several ways to solve this issue but they all add a lot of bloat and require wrapper objects on the client side for all values. The easiest solution by far is to allow numeric property names in the generated JSON structure.</p>

<p>I propose a new option for Zend_Json_Encoder called "allowNumericObjectProperties".</p>

<p>On the decoding side if a numeric object property is found the property shall be converted to a string and the property value shall be set to a wrapper object that indicates that the key for this value is numeric. This would enable the JSON string still to be converted to a proper object.</p>

<p>The above solution is preferred to generating the wrapper object into the JSON string as it would add a lot of extra characters to the JSON string if an associative array with lots of numeric keys is encoded.</p>

<p>The fact that associative PHP arrays are converted to JSON objects is not ideal to begin with, but the JSON specification does not provide for associative arrays at all.</p>

<p>We could alternatively introduce a JSON form for associative arrays:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
[ key : value , key : value ]
</code></pre>

<p>Where the key can be an integer or string and the value can be any valid JSON value.</p>

<p>Are there any other obvious solutions I am overlooking?</p>

<p>What is the consensus to adding such an option to the encoder?</p>

<h1>$logger-&gt;log(array('data' =&gt; array(0 =&gt; 1)), Zend_Log::DEBUG);</h1>

<p>Firebug will show:</p>

<h1>array(['data'] =&gt; 1)</h1>

<p>It is because the given array will be encoded to {'data':[1]} and [] is no associated array but I think the result is something "completely" different.</p>

<h1>array('data' =&gt; array(0 =&gt; 1)) != array('data' =&gt; 1)</h1>

            <p>I contacted Douglas Crockford of json.org about this. I asked the question:</p>

Are there any plans to support associative arrays with numeric indexes either by allowing numeric object property names or arrays with numeric and string keys in the JSON specification? If not, why not?

<p>{quote}
Of course not. It is possible to use PHP correctly. The JSON standard will not be changed to accommodate bad practices in the PHP community or any other community.

<p>What are the thoughts on this? Is it bad practice in the PHP community?</p>

            <p>It may be best to implement a Zend_Wildfire_Protocol_SerializedStream protocol handler that uses the PHP serialize method instead. That way we do not need to mess with Zend_Json_Encoder nor the JSON specification. The consequence is that the header data will be less portable.</p>
