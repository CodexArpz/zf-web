    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend\Http\Response is missing a constant for HTTP 308 Resume Incomplete. When trying to set this status code, it will throw an Exception.</p>

<p>The solution is to add the following line to the list of constants:
const STATUS_CODE_308 = 308;</p>

<p>This status code is used by Google Docs to upload files, so it might be a good addition.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The right solution for this is that Zend\Http\Response (as well as Request and Client) should stop validating things like status codes, method names etc. using a white-list of possible values, and switch to using the rules specified in the HTTP RFC. The RFC does allow not only codes like 308 but basically any 3-digit custom status codes are allowed.</p>

<p>I am working to change these in my Zend\Http rewrite branch, but this branch also includes a host of other major changes so I do not consider it a fix for this bug, at least not until it is decided to fully merge this branch (if at all).</p>
