    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I hope I'm not mistaken, but there doesn't seem to be a way of setting fieldset legends (I was using it with a subform, but I think it's generally a problem with fieldset decorator), I've looked at the code and it seems a problem with Zend_Form_Decorator_Fieldset as it doesn't handle the case when the element doesn't have a getLegend(). I think handling it would be to simply not set $attribs['legend'] as that overrides the existing legend (if it's set) by null.</p>

<p>Thank you and please forgive me if I missed something obvious</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Currently, Zend_Form (and, by extension, Zend_Form_SubForm) has a setLegend() method -- i.e., all major class types now have the method. I see no reason to pass the legend in the attribs at this point.</p>
