    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The manual, found at <a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en">http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/…</a>
lags really behind the current version. Much of it didn't work in beta4, even more is broken in beta5.</p>

<p>Even the quick start <a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/zend.mvc.quick-start.html">http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/…</a>
linked to from the beta5 release post at the zf2 blog contains errors that will make sure no one gets a project up and running. I commented this on the blog post, but no response.
One of the issues is that it's no longer called 'controller', but 'controllers', not 'classes' but 'invokables'. From this I have already seen many posts on different forums, SO etc.</p>

            <p>Marking this as incomplete, but that does not mean your report isn't. We are well aware that docs are lagging -- this is in part intentional, as it hasn't made a lot of sense to document code that may be in flux. As you've noticed already, doing so leads to documentation getting out-of-date quickly.</p>

<p>Beta5 is our last beta release before we declare a release candidate. At this time, we're shifting our focus to documentation, as the API is solidifying. You should see huge improvements in the documentation between now and the stable release.</p>

            <p>Sounds good.
Keep up the good work!</p>
