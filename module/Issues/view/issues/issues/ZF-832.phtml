    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>related to trunk revision 3058!</p>

<p>Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract::sendHeaders() ignores sending 
headers if output already is sent to the browser (checked by headers_sent()).
where the behaviour is not totally wrong the result is very annoying because
the method don't issues any errors that headers can't be send.</p>

<p>IMO the sendHeaders() method should throw an exception so that
developers can see why i.e. a redirect doesn't work correctly.
An alternative would be to implements a canSendHeaders() method
in the abstract response and force the redirect to throw an
exception. the latter makes exception with contextualized message
possible.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The biggest issue with this is how to test. When running the test suite, because the test runner is sending output continuously, headers are always sent -- which means that methods like sendHeaders (and, really, set(Raw)Header() and setRedirect()) would always throw exceptions in the test suite, and thus could not be tested easily.</p>

<p>My suggestion, then, is to have a flag that can be set that determines the behaviour. By default, it would be on, and exceptions would be thrown if headers have already been sent. If turned off, the methods would process as normal.</p>
