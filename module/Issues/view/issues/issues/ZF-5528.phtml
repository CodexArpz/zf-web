        <p><em>Update</em>
(It seems there are permission issues on the Bugtracker ... it will let me edit my original bug but not comment on it ... ???)</p>

<p>Benjamin, you're correct - thanks for the information.  Oddly, it seems that the demos on the jQuery site use an old version of AutoComplete.  For anyone else encountering this issue, the "newest" version that seems to work with 1.6rc4 was released with 1.6rc2 and is located here: [<a href="http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.6rc2/ui/ui.autocomplete.js">http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/…</a>].  There is also a development version (presumably fro jQuery 1.7) located here which may work [<a href="http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/autocomplete/ui/ui.autocomplete.js">http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/…</a>].  Both appear to be in sync with the docs and with Benjamin's implementation of the Autocomplete helper.</p>

<p>Problem solved.  Thanks.
<em>End Update</em></p>

<p>The ZendX_JQuery docs don't have a complete example of remote autocompletion using ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete and it seems that the implementation of it may be broken.  Would you please provide a full working example?  Here's what I tried - it doesn't seem to work as expected.</p>

<p>jQuery UI Autocomplete expects the URL for a remote autocomplete to be passed as a string (see actual javascript code for the jquery plugin here: [<a href="http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/plugins/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js">http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/…</a>]):</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$('#element').autocomplete('\/controller\/autocomplete');
</code></pre>

<p>... but ZendX_JQuery seems to generate code that passes it only as an object:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
&lt;?php
$element = new ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete('element');
$element-&gt;setJQueryParams(array('url' =&gt; '/controller/autocomplete'));
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>generates:</em></p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$("#element").autocomplete({"url":"\/controllers\/autocomplete"});
</code></pre>

<p>... which doesn't work because the Autocompleter sees an object as being passed, and assumes it is the 'data' object.  Using Firebug confirms that the component sees the 'url' value as a part of the 'data' array.</p>

<p>Have I misunderstood the implementation here?  A full example in the docs would be very helpful.</p>

            <p>This is not according to the preliminary documentation that was on the docs.jquery.com page.</p>

<p>I have working examples with Release Candidate 1 and 2 code that show the url parameter to work. Since the jQuery UI team removed the autocomplete widget from the 1.6 release plan I won't change anything on this component anymore until It is more stable.</p>

<p>I am sorry about this, but the problem is, when I wrote the jQuery view and form widgets last summer i thought 1.6 will be released in august, and with the autocomplete widget. This appeared not to be true :-)</p>
