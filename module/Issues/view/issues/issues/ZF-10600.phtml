    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>various options of the router can be configured via the application.ini and the Resource_Router object.</p>

<p>for example</p>

<p>useRequestParametersAsGlobal and chainNameSeparator can be configured. However the removeDefaultRoutes method cannot be called this way. You must override the configuraion in a Bootsstrap to disable the default routes.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to to that :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
   ...
        true/inde...
</code></pre>

<p>To have this working you would need to add the following to the getRouter method of Zend_Application_Resource_Router</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
public function getRouter() {
    ...
    if (isset($options['removeDefaultRoutes']) &amp;&amp; $options['removeDefaultRoutes'] == true) {
       $this-&gt;_router-&gt;removeDefaultRoutes();
    }
</code></pre>

            <p>True, your solution works. I did not think of it, thanks. I did try to create a 'fake' route called default to effectively disable the buildin routes this purpose (which for some reason did not work as expected).</p>

<p>However, by preference I don't like to call my route default when the only reason to call it that is to override the default routes. The name default might not be descriptive enough to a developer. He (or his colleague) cannot see the default router is removed by setting the default (he might not even know it is exist and can be turned off). He might think it can be renamed.</p>

<p>Can you follow this argumentation? I recognize that while not urgent - some might consider this a useful addition.</p>

<p>(thanks for your effort!)</p>
