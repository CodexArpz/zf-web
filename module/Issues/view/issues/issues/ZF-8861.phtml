    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Tested the functionality of isDate() with the following
(basically a number that IS divisible by 100 but NOT by 400):</p>

<p>$date = '29 February 1500';  // could try 100, 300, 700</p>

<p>if ( Zend_Date::isDate( $date,'dd MMMM yyyy', 'en' ) ) 
{
   print "<br />String $date is a date";
}
else
{
   print "<br />String $date is NO date";
}</p>

<p>returns: 
String 29 February 1500 is a date
But it SHOULD return false? divisible by 100 but NOT 400 ?</p>

<p>According to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year</a> --
"..Years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, 
unless they are also evenly divisible by 400, 
in which case they are leap years."</p>

<p>UNLESS - there is something that I dont understand about leap years and when they were implemented historically /etc.</p>

<p>What I was using for the logic in my own code was:</p>

<p>class CalendarDTO
{
    private $_calendar_year,
            $_is_leap_year,
            $_calendar_months ;</p>

<pre><code>...

public function setIsLeapYear( $year )
{
    /*
     * IS it a leap year?  *POSSIBLY*
     * year is divisible by 4..
     * so it *IS* a leap year well.. ( maybe )
     */
    if( $year % 4 == 0 )
    {
        $this-&gt;_is_leap_year = true ;

        /*
         * The year is divisible by 100..
         * so it is *NOT* a leap year.. well.. ( maybe )
         */
        if( $year % 100 == 0 )
        {
            $this-&gt;_is_leap_year = false ;
            /*
             * BUT the year is also divisible by 400
             *  so it IS a leap year after all
             */
            if( $year % 400 == 0  )
            {
               $this-&gt;_is_leap_year = true ;
            }
        }
    }
    // is NOT a leap year
    else
    {
        $this-&gt;_is_leap_year = false ;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>So it is very possible that I am clueless on the implementation of Leap Years and when they came into affect... etc.</p>

            <p>Closing as non-issue.</p>

<p>You can't execute Gregorian date functions on Julian dates.
The wikilink is not wrong... it just doesn't note some points on gregorian dates in general.</p>

The Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar.[1][2][3] It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582, a papal bull known by its opening words Inter gravissimas.
