    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>If I read correctly, Zend_Amf supports AMF3, but I encounter this case :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
class Obj {
public $innerObj;

// create Obj instances
$o1 = new Obj();
$o2 = new Obj();
$o3 = new Obj();

// obj3 is shared between o1 and o2
$o1-&gt;innerObj = $o3;
$o2-&gt;innerObj = $o3;

// this is sent by AMF
$ret = array($o1, $o2);

</code></pre>

<p>Flex sees two diferrent innerObj instances...</p>

<p>(I also tried to set restore-references to true in flex's services-config, without success)</p>

            <p>As far as I've seen, the current AMF Serializer doesn't write class traits nor references. So your findings are definitely a missing feature on the Zend_Amf side. I'll also need that feature soon. 
Wade do you already have a schedule for this? - I could possibly work on a patch for that, but only if there are chances to get the patch committed...</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>As promised, here is a patch to for the Amf3 Serializer. It is rather huge as support for object references has an impact on nearly everything of the current serializer. (This patch is against revision 15132 in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/incubator">http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦</a> )</p>

<p>The following features were added:
- support for String references
- support for classTrait references
- support for object references (Objects, Arrays, XMLStrings, ByteArrays, Dates)</p>

<p>There is one notable glitch introduced with this patch:
There is no support for dynamic classes beside the use of stdClass. (There never has been support for this, but the old serializer didn't use class trait references, and therefore treated each object on its own,  and dynamic properties on the same class were automatically sent). We might add something like _isDynamic or getASDynamic to indicate, if a class is dynamic...</p>

<p>I've tested most of the code, except the ByteArray support. A descent testsuite is still needed.</p>

<p>BTW. This patch also addresses the problems discussed in  ZF-6205.</p>

<p>Comments and (failing) tests are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Cheers
 Stefan</p>

            <p>Thank you Stefan !!! Everything works in my tests, the patch works great ! (just had to correct a small miss at line 216 this -&gt; $this)</p>

<p>BTW, what are "dynamic classes" ?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the correction. (as I said a testsuite is still needed ;-)) I attached a new patch with the added $.
Dynamic classes are classes where each instance can have different properties. The typical dynamic class is stdClass in PHP and Object is ActionScript. In ActionScript you can make a class dynamic by using the [Dynamic] metadata tag, whereas in PHP you can create them by overriding the __set __get magical functions.</p>

            <p>Ok that's what I thought it was... We are using these behaviors, and in my tests your patch seems to work as expected !??.</p>

<p>Here is what I do on AS side :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
package com.vega.core.model.amf
{
    [RemoteClass(alias="com.vega.core.model.amf.InnerObj")]
    dynamic public class InnerObj
    {
        public var a:String;
    }
}
package com.vega.core.model.amf
{
    [RemoteClass(alias="com.vega.core.model.amf.Obj")]
    public class Obj
    {
        public var innerObj:InnerObj;

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on PHP side :</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
class Obj
{
    public $_explicitType = "com.vega.core.model.amf.Obj";
    // public $innerObj;
}

class InnerObj
{
    public $_explicitType = "com.vega.core.model.amf.InnerObj";
    public $a = "youhou";
}

function testReferences ()
{
    $a = new Obj();
    $a-&gt;innerObj = new InnerObj();
    // try dynamic member
    $a-&gt;innerObj-&gt;b = "test";

    $b = new Obj();    
    $b-&gt;innerObj = $a-&gt;innerObj;
    
    return array($a,$b);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I get the corrrect result in AS i.e. :
- same reference to innerObj
- innerObj having a dynamic member b = "test"</p>

<p>In which cases will this fail ?</p>

            <p>Hi Mat,</p>

<p>I currently don't have the time to check this. I'm on vacation for one week.
But I'm a bit puzzled, that you didn't get a php error when accessing $a-&gt;innerObj (the innerObj member was commented out in class Obj) and I would 
$a-&gt;innerObj-&gt;b expect to throw an error because of an undefined member b.</p>

<p>If that works for you it will most likely fail if you instntiate a second InnerObj, and define a dynamic member c. From this object only the members of the instance which occured first will get transferred.
eg: innerObj1-&gt;b = "bb"
innerObj2-&gt;c = "cc"</p>

<p>will result in 2 objects, one with b="aa" and the second with b=null and c undefined</p>

<p>Regards Stefan</p>

            <p>Hi Wade,</p>

<p>please revert the last commit to Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Serializer.php, then my patch should apply cleanly (I didn't try, only had a look at the SVN log). That last commit (ZF-6205/patch_serializer_v2.patch) is incomplete, breaks AMF serialization (as it doesn't reference XML, Dates etc.) and is completely replaced by my patch.</p>

            <p>Hi Wade,</p>

<p>I updated the patch to work with todays standard trunk (011-Zend_Amf_Parse_Amf3_Serializer.patch) and also attached my complete Serializer.php</p>

<p>BTW could you explain the exact semantics of the Incubator? I thought the Incubator is always the bleeding edge and the place for experimentation, whilest the trunk is a mostly stable version and only takes commits for files which don't exist in the incubator or copies from the incubator. But the Amf3 Serializer exists in Incubator, still you are committing to trunk. How are users expected to handle this situation?
I normally place the incubator before the trunk in my php include path, so that the Incubator is layered ontop of trunk. This no longer works in the Serializer case, as trunk is newer.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for clarification.</p>

<p>Regards Stefan</p>

            <p>Hello Wade, 
Thanks for your good work and this great framework!
You asked for experiences regarding the fix. Well
If one AMF3-Message contains string references as well as Bytearrays, the string references are getting mixed up - depending on the transmission order, string references are then wrong deserialized.
This is because (at least I think so) string references are kept in a separate virtual table to complex objects virtual table.
Because in the deserializer, the reading of bytearrays are traited as reading strings (see l. 107: 
case Zend_Amf_Constants::AMF3_BYTEARRAY:
                 return $this-&gt;readString();
)
the string reference array gets mixed up when reading a bytearray.
I think, the reading of bytearrays should go into the table $_referenceObjects</p>

<p>Here, the next question comes in: when reading complex objects, like dates, the method calls readString - if the date object has a reference inside (I am not whether this is possible at all), the readString method puts the complex object again in the $_stringReferences.</p>

<p>Thanks again for this framework, I am using it on a daily basis and like it very much,
timtom</p>
