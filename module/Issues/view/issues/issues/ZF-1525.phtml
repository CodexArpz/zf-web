    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When a PUT or DELETE operation is performed and Zend_Gdata_App::_httpMethodOverride is set to 'true', a header called x-http-method-override is added to the Zend_Http_Client object being used to indicate that, even though a POST operation is being performed, a PUT or DELETE should be performed instead.</p>

<p>However, for subsequent requests, the header remains set in the client.  Thus, performing a POST to insert a new entry will also include a x-http-method-override header based upon the last set value.</p>

<p>Along with calling Zend_Http_Client::resetParameters() with each HTTP operation, any x-http-method-override headers set int he client should be removed.</p>

            <p>Removed x-http-method-override header along with each call to resetParameters, to prevent it from being improperly included in requests which shouldn't have it</p>
