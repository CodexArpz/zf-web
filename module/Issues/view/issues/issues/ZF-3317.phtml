    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, setLocale() parses out the information it needs from the supplied locale. This is problematic when trying to change the locale.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$locale = new Zend_Locale('en_US');
$translate = new Zend_Translate(array(), $locale);
$locale-&gt;setLocale('fr_CA');
echo $translate-&gt;getLocale() // en_US
</code></pre>

<p>It would be nice if Zend_Translate stored the locale by reference instead of breaking it apart. I only see one problem refactoring the code, pertaining to the:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
        if (!array_key_exists($locale, $this-&gt;_translate) and empty($this-&gt;_translate[$locale])) {
            $temp = explode('_', $locale);
            if (!array_key_exists($temp[0], $this-&gt;_translate)) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Translate_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Language ({$locale}) has to be added before it can be used.");
            }
            $locale = $temp[0];
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, some additional logic would be required to automatically downgrade the Locale object.</p>

            <p>This would not work.</p>

<p>*) You can have multiple locales.
When you add new translation files, each one with a locale object, which one should be referenced ? There is no way to select this.</p>

<p>*) What should be done when you change the language of your locale object to a unsupported language ? 
Actually a exception is raised, but this could not be done when coupling the locale object. This leads to unexpected behaviour in translation.</p>

<p>*) What if you change the locale object in the middle of a translation ?
Your translation would change the language which is not wished.</p>

<p>The decission to NOT HARD-COUPLE locale with translation was made because of this reasons in past and serveral more...</p>

            <p>Interesting... all good points. My approach of passing a single locale object around my classes is obviously not the correct approach. I obviously need to re-approach the problem from a different angle.</p>

            <p>Let's say, to reference a single locale may fit perfectly in your case.
But for the framework we must be more generic.</p>

<p>And as you already mentioned it's easy to have only a single locale within your application if you code it right.</p>

<p>We will close this issue as "won't fix"... feel free to add new improvements anytime.</p>
