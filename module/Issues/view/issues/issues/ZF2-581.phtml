    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This actually has more to do with Zend\Mail\Storage\Message</p>

<p>Here are the email headers giving the problems (I truncated them, since it contains an image) -&gt; <a href="http://pastebin.com/x0iPrF48">http://pastebin.com/x0iPrF48</a>
This email was created using this example -&gt; <a href="http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/zend.mail.file.options.html">http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/â€¦</a></p>

<p>So the email is stored in a file and later I open it with $message = new Zend\Mail\Storage\Message(array('file' =&gt; $filename));
When you attempt to send the email using Zend\Mail\Message you are given this error:</p>

<p>Caught Exception
Zend\Mail\Exception\RuntimeException does not match header format!
This is a message in Mime Format.  If you see this, your mail reader does not support this format.</p>

<p>After trying several things out I decided to open the email saved to file and remove the line regarding it being in Mime Format. To my surprise, the email was instantly sent without a problem. Looking at the email in my inbox, I see the Mime Format line was automagically added back and everything worked as expected.</p>

<p>This does not happen when the email is not in Mime Format, it works perfectly and as expected.</p>
