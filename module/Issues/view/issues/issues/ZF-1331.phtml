    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Probably barely worth noting this so early, but why are the error messages defined internally?  They barely make it past readable English in some instances. "has not only alphanumeric" is not all that readable - it doesn't sound right even if the grammer is technically correct. Simpler English would be much better. Also there's not obvious attach point for custom messages.</p>

<p>Like I said, probably too early. I'm sure the messages property is an array for some future reason.</p>

            <p>You bring up a good point, and this issue has come up before on the mailing lists. It is important to note the difference between the messages that Zend_Validate provides and the messages that you would provide to a user of the web application. Indeed, the messages from Zend_Validate are intended to inform the application developer of the specific reason(s) why a particular validation failed. Depending on the situation, such distinctions may be important (e.g., tracking data for usability analyses). The messages from Zend_Validate are not generally intended for display to application users, however, because the messages do not convey anything specific with respect to the application context in which the messages were generated.</p>

<p>A developer should instead decide, based on the particulars of the application, how to form the messaging between the application and the user. These requirements are likely to vary widely, and so far we have left concrete solutions for application developers to craft. If a generalized solution is feasible and sensible, it should be appropriate to more fully <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/k">develop the ideas into a clear proposal</a> to be reviewed for possible inclusion after 1.0.0.</p>

<p>This issue is also related to <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/D2k">ZF-904], in that user-definable error messages are not limited to the those messages internal to Zend_Validate. Similar limitations apply to messages used with classes derived from Exception throughout the framework.</a></p>

<p>Finally, you may wish to examine and comment on the [new Zend_Filter_Input proposal, which may also be considered related to this issue.</p>
