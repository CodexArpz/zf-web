    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The code below always fire for me, even though I have a validator . I don't think it's tested by the validator, since I can only find one instance of the words move_uploaded_file in my Zend library. My guess is that one really want to test is_uploaded_file instead, to make sure its a valid uploaded file.</p>

<p>I validate, as one should, and then try to receive the file. What happens is that the move_uploaded_file below renames the file, making it inaccessible to the validators.</p>

<p>FILE: Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Http.php
FUNCTION: receive</p>

<p>// Should never go here as it's tested by the upload validator
if (!move_uploaded_file($content['tmp_name'], ($directory . $content['name']))) {
     return false;
}</p>

Your example code is not related to Zend_File_Transfer.</p>

            <p>And what exactly is your problem?</p>

<p>API DOC reads:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    /**
     * Receive the file from the client (Upload)
     *
</code></pre>

<p>Which really receives the file.
When you want to check the file why don't you simply use isValid() like described in the manual ?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Validation is always done BEFORE moving the file.
Looking at the method you are mocking about you will see the isValid is called BEFORE doing move_uploaded file.</p>

<p>When your validation fails, you should simply look what your validation errors look like.</p>

<p>RECEIVE() RECEIVES THE FILE, WHICH MEANS FOR HTTP THAT IT IS MOVED FROM TEMPORARY LOCATION TO THE SET DIRECTORY. THIS IS NOT A FAILURE, THIS IS EXPECTED AND WISHED BEHAVIOUR.</p>

            <p>No error at all... receive MUST receive the file. Validations are always done before.
Always look at the example code in the manual for proper handling.</p>
