    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>CUrrently, there's no way to achieve a button (or submitbutton or resetbutton for that matter) without the "value" attribute. IE will, however, display the value instead of the button contents + iconClass as does FF. This may be regarded as a Dojo problem, but still I'd prefer we have control over the generated code by not including "value" as tag attribute.</p>

            <p>Actually, this isn't a Dojo problem, but a browser issue, so "value" must be omitted when creating button dijits unless specifically added in the attributes array.</p>

            <p>This problem has been annoying me over the past three months, and neither here nor on the forums have I received any response regarding this issue. I would love to provide a resolution if only I understood why the value is notoriously injected in button code, even if manually setting value to null won't do, so I keep resorting to manually coding button HTML, which surely isn't the point of the framework... Please at least set the status to confirmed or will not fix</p>
