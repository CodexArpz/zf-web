    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The following piece of code get me the wrong year piece in the timestamp to date conversion result;</p>

<p>$date = new Zend_Date(1356974896, Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP);
$str = $date-&gt;get("MM-dd-YYY");</p>

<p>I get '12-31-2013' instead of '12-31-2012' as expected. Other timestamps that fall into 2012 work ok though...maybe something due to the last day of the year ?</p>

<p>This same piece of code was working and returning correct dates for a long time, I just got this reported to me for specific entries, the common denominator as I was saying is that they are all of 12-31-2012.</p>

<p>Hope this input helps.</p>

<p>Regards,
Gonzalo.</p>

            <p>This is now fixed as of r24880 on trunk, and will release with 1.12.0.</p>

<p>Basically, it's an issue with the "o" format identifier; first and last week of the year cause issues, and are often reported with the previous and next year, respectively. (See <a href="http://php.net/date">http://php.net/date</a> and look for the "o" format in there for details.)</p>
