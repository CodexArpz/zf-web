    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Mail_Storage_Pop3 is unable to fetch messeges from SmarterMail server. 
I was trying to run script from my local machine and from production server (web server and mail server are running on the same machine, but have different IP) and in both cases script stops afeter some time without error messege.</p>

<p>I've install WIreShark on my local machine. I've run my script and Thunderbird, and I saw that TB sends CAPA header -&gt; so I've modified Zend_Mail_Protocol_Pop3::connect() by adding $this-&gt;capa(), but it didn't help. Next few attempts and I figured out that the problem is proably in TCP connections.</p>

            <p>I installed SmarterMail and found a bug in the pop3 protocol code, but I had different symptoms (server didn't read request), so I don't know if it fixes your problem. Could you replace 
        $result = @fputs($this-&gt;_socket, $request . "\n");
with
        $result = @fputs($this-&gt;_socket, $request . "\r\n");
in Zend_Mail_Protocol_Pop3::sendRequest() and test again, please?</p>

<p>We don't send CAPA because it's not needed. POP3 is very liberal - you may send commands without knowing if the server supports it, what we do with TOP (but only once). Some servers lie in their CAPA so it's better to just try.</p>

            <p>Thank you. It was all my fault. The RFC clearly states commands should be terminated by  and I don't know why I did this wrong. It's a luck there's a strict mail server ;) You'll find the fix in SVN and the next release.</p>
