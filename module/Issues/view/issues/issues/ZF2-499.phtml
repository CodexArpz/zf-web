    <div class="body">
        <p>In all the browsers I've been testing, Safari seems to be the only one experiencing this issue. The page will not load, returns a white page. Checking the system logs this is the full error I am receiving:</p>

<p>Not sure why this is happening to be honest. Testing browsers on Windows 7 are Firefox, IE, Chrome, Safari. If I access this in another browser, watching the logs absolutely no error is returned.</p>

<p>I should mention that I am currently using the latest version of Zend as of 08-23-2012 (looks like RC5 as of now).</p>

<p>Let me know if I can produce any other materials and I'll be happy to help.</p>

            <p>I guess that is something related with the last ":" in [fd35:4776:6804:2:2:]</p>

            <p>I should of added that the URL I'm accessing is [fd35:4776:6804:2:2::2]. Something I hadn't noticed the logs did not show.</p>

            <p>As far as I see it, the Zend\Uri\Uri::setHost already gets the trunkated IP-Address as parameter as the Exception states "[fd35:4776:6804:2:2:]" as the problematic IP. This is the IP-That gets submitted as Parameter.</p>

<p>I've found a part in Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Request::setServer() where the port gets removed from the Server 'name' 'when $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] is not set'. Why this is happening only with your Safari-Browser I currently can not tell as my Safari does not behave like that. Which Safari-Version do you use? When I get that, I can dig into this further.</p>

            <p>Safari Version: 5.1.7 (7534.57.2) Windows 7</p>

<p>Because I don't know if you know how IPv6 addresses work I'll just mention this. Keep in mind I'm accessing the IPv6 address of [fd35:4776:6804:2:2::2]. Notice there is no port number here, otherwise it would be written as [fd35:4776:6804:2:2::2]:80. The long version of this address would look like this [fd35:4776:6804:0002:0002:0000:0000:0002]. I have tried this as well but the results are the same.</p>

<p>As an additional test I setup an actual hostname and pointed it to this IP Address and Safari works. So that at least rules out any coding problems I may have caused for this to happen which I am unaware about.</p>

<p>I also tried an IPv4 address and it works too.</p>

<p>My only guess is that somewhere it's taking the : or :: in the IPv6 address and treating it like a port number, where-as it should not.</p>

<p>As stated before, I'm willing to help out as much as I can. Just hope I didn't push anyone's buttons by my IPv6 statement above.</p>

            <p>Can you give us a var_dump of the $_SERVER-variable? I'm guessing, that some part of that array is missing and therefore the setServer-method does some magic that does not give the correct results. But to make that clear, we would need the var_dump. Actually it's just whether the key 'SERVER_NAME' is present or not.</p>

            <p>Here are two vardumps so you have something to compare:</p>

<h1>Firefox</h1>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I found the cause of the issue.</p>

<p>The var_Dumps you provided showed the following lines:</p>

<p>Firefox: 
["SERVER_NAME"]=&gt; string(19) "zf2.sitegoodies.net"
["SERVER_ADDR"]=&gt; string(21) "fd35:4776:6804:2:2::2"
["SERVER_PORT"]=&gt; string(2) "80"</p>

<p>Safari: 
["SERVER_NAME"]=&gt; string(21) "[fd35:4776:6804:2:2:]"
["SERVER_ADDR"]=&gt; string(21) "fd35:4776:6804:2:2::2"
["SERVER_PORT"]=&gt; string(1) "2"</p>

<p>This shows, that the SERVER_NAME is already broken when sent from Safari to the Server. But that is the value that is used by the Request-Object to feed the host-name (which could be an IP) to the Uri-Object.</p>

<p>This seems to be a general PHP-Issue, not a ZF-Issue.</p>

<p>Sorry, but ZF can't know that that is already broken. :-(</p>

            <p>aha! At least we found it =)</p>

<p>I was hesitant to even open this bug due to the possibility that it would be a browser issue. In your view, do you think this yields a PHP bug instead?</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to check this out =)</p>

            <p>I think a special case where the user agent is known and we have something looking like an IPv6 address might make sense -- if it has happened once, it may happen again.</p>
