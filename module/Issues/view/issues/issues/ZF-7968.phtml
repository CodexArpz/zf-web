        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am not 100% sure about the problem as i didn't reduced the code to minimal.</p>

<p>But there are working the ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element's elements without a layout ?</p>

<p>I was trying to generate by Ajax a subform, and at rendering the jquery and jquery ui libraries are loaded quite fine, also the form is displayed correctly, just that is not rendered at all the javascript to initialize the datepicker.</p>

<p>If i make the request not disable the layout then the JS side is rendered fine.</p>

            <p>It depends on where you call to render the Javascript.</p>

<p>Layout is renedered after all the views, that way a call in the header to jQuery render() catches all the "previous" calls in the view.</p>

<p>However without a layout you have to render jQuery at the bottom of the view.</p>

            <p>Ok, thanks, the JS with setting the datepicker is added the way you proposed (maybe would be useful to add a mention to documentation as well), so you're right...</p>

<p>However, still there is a problem: the JS doesn't seems to be executed, so datepicker is not actually working.</p>

<p>I suppose this is due to fact the JS is added with $(document).ready(function() , and since the document has been loaded before the code for setting the datepicker doesn't get executed.</p>

<p>There is a way to make this works also ?</p>

            <p>For me document.ready works inside </p> also. I am not very familiar with the semantics though.

<p>What would you suggest instead as code at this place?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I think was a confusion. Is not about the fact that the JS code doesn't work if added on body under a normal request (non-ajax).</p>

<p>If i have an ajax request and i am adding dynamically (using an ajax request) the datepicker to the main form (from the page which made the ajax request), the entire code is placed without no problem.</p>

<p>Problem is the document.ready of datepicker is added AFTER the page was created, because is sent by Ajax. So, this document.ready is NOT executed then. So datepicker (or other ZendX_JQuery view helpers/form elements won't work).</p>

            <p>I got more info related to the issue.</p>

<p>On IE all works fine. However, on FF no, the javascript code inserted by Ajax call doesn't get executed.</p>

            <p>Its a common problem that can't be solved with ZendX_JQuery, you have to add the jQuery to render the element as datepicker using the addOnLoad() method.</p>
