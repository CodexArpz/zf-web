    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p><em>Summary</em>
Zend_Gdata_App::retrieveAllEntriesForFeed() is declared as static, yet it attempts to access $this-&gt;getFeed(), which is invalid. As a result, this function reliably causes a crash whenever a multi page feed is encountered.</p>

<p><em>Regression</em>
Feature introduced in r5899.</p>

<p><em>Notes</em>
The fix for this is simple: just declare retrieveAllEntriesForFeed() as non-static. I already have a patch tested and ready to go.</p>

<p>The bigger question is why this wasn't flagged in the existing unit tests. It seems that it didn't become an issue until my test Google Apps account hit around ~100 users, which suggests that the minimum number of entries required to activate paging is much higher than I had expected when designing tests.</p>

<p>Since the 1.0.1 code freeze is coming up shortly, I'm going to focus on getting on getting this reviewed and checked in to release-1.0. After that's taken care of I'll perform a more thorough analysis of how this slipped under the radar and what changes need to be made to existing tests to prevent this in the future.</p>
