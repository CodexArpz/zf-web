    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Action helper's init() method is called in Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::__construct().</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    public function __construct(Zend_Controller_Action $actionController)
    {
        $this-&gt;_actionController = $actionController;

        foreach (self::$_helpers as $helper) {
            $helper-&gt;init();
        }
    }

</code></pre>

<p>Because a helper broker object is created in Zend_Controller_Action::__construct in order for the init() method to be called the helpers would have to be added before the action object is created.</p>

<p>This results in helper's init() method not being called at all in most cases.</p>

<p>Proposed solution:</p>

<p>in file  HelperBroker.php</p>

<ul><li>delete the foreach loop from constructor</li>
<li>put $helper-&gt;init();  in method getHelper (line 183) after $helper-&gt;setActionController($this-&gt;_actionController);</li>
</ul><p>This will cause the init() method to be called every time a helper is being fetched in action.</p>

<p>I think this is consistent with the manual:
{quote}
init(), triggered by the helper broker at instantiation, can be used to trigger initialization in the helper; this can be useful for resetting state when multiple controllers use the same helper in chained actions.
{quote}</p>

<p>It is also important when init() method will be called the helpers __actionController will be set.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>init() was designed for use with persistent helpers, and/or helpers that may need to reset state if used in multiple controllers. It is called in two situations:</p>

<ul><li>If the helper has been loaded globally (i.e., from the bootstrap), init() will be called everytime a controller class is instantiated by the dispatcher.</li>
<li>The first time a helper is instantiated via getHelper().</li>
</ul><p>Basically, init() is called when needed. If you want it to run at instantiation, perform a call to it in your constructor.</p>
