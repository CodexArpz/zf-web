<p>The component you selected contains 9 pages with more than 5500 words. That's the reason why I asked for the related page.</p>

            <p>Won't fix.</p>

<p>Zusicherung is the wrong translation for this verb.
Additionally there is no verb "Ausnahme" within the noted chapter.</p>

            <p>You are very funny Thomas. I found "Ausnahme" more than 40 times on the German manual page linked above.</p>

<p>"Zusicherung" is also the correct wording for assertion. The verb should be "zusichern" (to assert).</p>

<p>At the moment the (German) world could thought that zf developers don't know the difference between an exception and an assertion. If you know a better translation than "Zusicherung" please let me know.</p>

            <p>My German is not good enough to judge on this usse. But please not that Thomas wrote 'verb ausnahme', and from what I can tell, the only occurences of Ausnahme are nouns rather than verbs.</p>

            <p>Just compare the English and German chapters. Each time when "Zusichern" should be wrote "Aushnahme" is written. It's not that difficult.</p>

            <p>I searched the complete chapter for Zend_Test_PhpUnit within trunk.</p>

<p>There is no "Ausnahme" in the complete chapter. The verb "assertion" is translated with "Behauptung" which is the correct translation for assertion as you assert something.</p>

<p>I don't see how I should change verbs which are not available in the manual.</p>

            <p>You should have searched within the links i posted above.</p>

<p>In German books about unit testing i always read "Zusicherung", but "Behauptung" is also ok.</p>

            <p>Why should I search the link?</p>

<p>We have no access to the link you provided.
But I searched within the manual which is what you noted as being failed.</p>

<p>You should additionally note that this issue is marked as "fixed" for the next minor release.</p>

            <p>I linked to the current online version of the manual, so if you follow the link you will see what this issue is about.</p>

<p>You say it's already fixed in trunk, that's nice.</p>

            <p>Please stop being ridiculous.</p>

<p>As I said already before the community, including me as being community member, has no access to the servers from Zend which are hosting the homepage.</p>

<p>We have no write access to these sites. So we can't change the content from these servers.</p>

<p>This issue is ALREADY MARKED AS FIXED SINCE 2 DAYS FOR THE NEXT RELEASE.
Which means that it will automatically being fixed with the next release for public.</p>

<p>There is no other way to solve such issues.
We will wether build a new release for this single bug, nor change the homepage until the next release will be official released.</p>
