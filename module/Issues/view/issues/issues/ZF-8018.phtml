    <div class="body">
        <p>Disable the layout in Zend_Rest_Controller</p>

<p>The user can disable the layout himself/herself. But it's nice to have the layout disabled by default when requests are routed to Zend_Rest_Controller.</p>

<p>If you like a patch, let me know. :)</p>

            <p>I disagree with this. REST does not imply that there will not be a layout by any means, and I actually have RESTful resources that display both HTML as well as JSON; the former uses a layout, while the latter does not.</p>

            <p>Besides the reasons mentioned in my previous comment, changing the behavior at this point would be a backwards compatibility break. Both are sufficient reasons to close this issue.</p>
