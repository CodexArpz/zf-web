    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>We have been using Zend_Form for some time now and I have recently been having an issue with a particular application where if the validation of the form failed any escaped character would get escaped an additional time. Eventually ending up with strings in the post such as:</p>

<p>product "name" -&gt; product \\"name\\"</p>

<p>The problem is that when you get the post array it is escaped and when you put it in to zend_form to validate:</p>

<p>$form-&gt;isValid($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getPost())</p>

<p>It will continually escape and re-escape the variables. Quotes in input are generally infrequent but we have just started implementing a product description input which of course has strings such as:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p class="bold"&gt;</p>

<p>which are heavily effected. There are of course workarounds to the problem such as recursively striping slashes from the post array before giving it to the zend_form, but for ease I would expect that you would be able to pass the post array straight to the form.</p>

            <p>This is not a problem of Zend_Form, rather that you are using magic quotes, which it is commonly agreed, should <em>not</em> be relied upon.</p>

<p>You should turn of magic quotes.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the swift response, turning off magic quotes fixed the issue. We have magic quotes off, but this was a virtual box that had recently been set up for development and this configuration was missed.</p>
