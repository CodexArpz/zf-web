    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I couldn't get assertQuery from <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.test.phpunit.html">Zend_Test_PHPUnit</a> working. Then I tried to hack in the ZF code and I realized that XPath does not work when there are warnings in the DOMDocument:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc-&gt;loadXML('Fine');
$xpath = new DOMXPath($doc);
echo 'Count: ' . $xpath-&gt;evaluate('count(/root/node)') . "\n"; //1

$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc-&gt;loadXML('Unknown entity ©');
$xpath = new DOMXPath($doc);
echo 'Count: ' . $xpath-&gt;evaluate('count(/root/node)') . "\n"; //0
</code></pre>

<p>When the Zend_Test_PHPUnit_Constraint_DomQuery instances Zend_Dom_Query which loads the document (with unknown entities), it does not produce any warnings (although, there are populated in the documentErrors propery).</p>

<p>The assert just fails as if the XPath returned no results.</p>

            <p>If the document is malformed, why would it return results? Or are you suggesting we throw an exception?</p>

            <p>It should do something. Either try to recover and ignore that unknown entity along with issuing a warning or fail completly and throw "malformed document" exception. Only thing it SHOULD NOT do is to fail silently IMO.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick answer!</p>

<p>The first problem is that is fails with misleading error.</p>

<p>I have a test that does assertQuery() on response (using PHPUnit and Zend_Test), and when the returned webpage is not valid XML (although it is returned as valid xhtml from w3.org validator), it fails the assertion (failed asserting that sth is present). I would have expected to get info saying "Document is malformed, couldn't evaluate the XPath expression.".</p>

<p>Another problem is, that the document type detection perfomed in Zend_Dom_Query is based on document content, which resolves to xml, despite the fact that webpage returns header "Content-Type:text/html". (It parses fine when I hack the ZF code to force the parsing as HTML. Also the XPath works fine in this case).</p>

            <p>Attaching patch, which changes the regex added in ZF-11376 (+test)</p>

<p>It fixes this issue and does not break any tests for Zend_Dom</p>
