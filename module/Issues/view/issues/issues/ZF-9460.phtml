    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I open a pdf file
I delete some pages using unset($pdf-&gt;pages[$id]);
and I save the file $pdf-&gt;save($filename)
If I open the file with a pdf reader I see only the remaining pages.
But since the resulting file size was basically the same size I opened it with a text editor to check it and I found out the all the deleted pages are still there.
It seem that deleting pages unlink them from the visualization but not delete the info from the file content.
I dunno if this is the normal behaviour of the save method.</p>

<p>Looking at the api I saw that there is a parameter, so I tried to use $pdf-&gt;save($filename, $updateOnly) with  $updateOnly=true.
I thought that this is the way to have only the remaining pages in the file, so as result I expect to have the file with only the remaining pages (both visualization and file content).</p>

<p>As result I got a file that apparently has only the remaining pages (looking at the size) but all the pages are blank, no text in them.</p>
