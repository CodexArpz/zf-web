            <p>Is this referring to a daemon-style solution, or merely the ability to create feeds with Zend_Feed? At this point, I think the latter capability is supported, and it may just be that this issue was filed prior to that support being added. Please elaborate.</p>

            <p>This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.</p>

            <p>Zend_Feed's purpose is to consume and generate feeds. Serving them is a simple matter handled by any Controller. To preserve a greater range of response flexibility, it would not be appropriate to implement Zend_Feed as a "server". Such functionality has little worth in an MVC application, and a standalone implementation would not offer much of value.</p>
