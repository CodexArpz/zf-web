            <p>Could you be clear about what you expected and what you got?</p>

<p>I have performed the test as you suggested, and the var comes through as 'var test' as I would expect (spaces in a url are encoded as +, or %20), this is simply an artifact of the url decoding. if you wish to send a + character, then you should have that encoded correctly, as it is a special reserved character for url's.</p>

<p>If you simply expected a +, then this issue should be closed as a non-issue, as the + should be encoded as %2B, otherwise, please provide more information.</p>
