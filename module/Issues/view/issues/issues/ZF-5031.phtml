    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>First of all In the components list of this issue there is no Zend_Auth_Adapter_Db_Table.</p>

<p>In the _authenticateValidateResultSet method of this class, there can be only one result from the array. This is a problem if we have (like in sugar for example) a deleted = 1 row that defines if some records are deleted and there is more than 1 row with the same username, of course credential treatment fails (the columns in data base are correct) but it fails to complete validation in PHP (because of the count() in the method reported above.</p>

<p>Thank you for this great Framework ;)</p>

            <p>Actually, I think there are already some features in place that will take care of this scenario.  Please see:</p>

<p><a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.adapter.dbtable.html#zend.auth.adapter.dbtable.advanced.advanced_usage">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a></p>

<p>So specifically, you might want to do this:</p>

<p>$adapter = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable(
    $db,
    'users',
    'username',
    'password',
    'MD5(?) AND deleted != 1"'
);</p>

<p>If this doesnt solve your issues, please reopen as I am marking as not an issue.</p>

            <p>The problem is exactly that. If I have the same user (username) and one of them has deleted = 0 and then I create a new user (with the same username, which is possible because the other is deleted) I'll have 2 records 1 of them is deleted=0. In the database I have 2 rows and the column to be validated is correct 0 on the first, 1 on the next. But the validation fails because of the method I quoted before. It will try to get 1 record only. Everything else returns an error...
This is not an error it's a perfectly valid query and the method should go for each value search if at least one is returning 1 on the zend_auth column.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time</p>
