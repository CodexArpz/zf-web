    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>in Zend/Locale/Format.php line 337 an iconv function is used but it's never checked if the extension is loaded (like many other parts of the framework do), you should the "extension_loaded" check like in Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php line 96</p>

            <p>iconv is a default extension for all php versions. This means it is always available as long as it is not erased manually.</p>

<p>The whole I18n core does not work when iconv is not available.
This is noted in the manual and also the requirements.</p>

<p>Personally I am against such a change because of performance. I will check with the dev-team.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>iconv is available in a vanilla PHP installation; you have to pass a switch at compile time to <em>disable</em> it. As such, it was decided some time ago that we would do no checks for this particular extension.</p>

<p>(The DB adapters are different in this regard as most of the DB adapters must be explicitly enabled at compile time, and will availability will differ between installations.)</p>
