    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Actually, when you request the DB, the adapter is told to automaticaly physically connect to the RDBM, throught a connect() method in the used Adapter.</p>

<p>An idea would be to have something like $myAdapter-&gt;lazyConnect(false).
When set to false, you will have to open the connection manually before any request, ZF wont manage this automaticaly for you any more.</p>

<p>Additionnaly, we could use some kind of $myAdapter-&gt;closeConnection(true), which then could tell the adapter that it has passed in a non lazy mode : all future requests will then throw exception if the connection has not been opened manually by the developper.</p>

<p>This can be usefull in some (rare) cases :
Imagine that I close the connection myself, manually : $myAdapter-&gt;closeConnection().
I would like to expect my adapter to be really closed : I could expect it not to further open back the connexion if some requests stays pending in my late program.</p>

<p>I have already thought about that, and I have some patches and can discuss that idea with anyone who seems interested ... :-)</p>

            <p>I really don't see any use for this.</p>

<p>If you are using ZF's factory for creating DB connections, the connection is lazy loaded (your first sentence states that the connection is made when you request the DB, which is not true, the connection is established when you send your first query to the database).</p>

<p>Since the connection is opened the first time you send a query to the database, you can close it with the closeConnection() manually.</p>

<p>It looks to me like you are using some bad programming practices if you want do deny the connection to the database for the part of the program. Why not just end your program after closing the connection, or set a flag in Zend_Registry that should be checked later in the program and just skip the other requests so you don't generate errors or error exceptions?</p>

            <p>Don't worry, I don't carry bad programming practices, that is just an idea, but I agree that we should find a useness ...</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>To open a connection, all one has to do is $adapter-&gt;connect(), conversely, in recent (more recent than when this issue was submitted) releases we've implemented a closeConnection() method.</p>

<p>Please reopen if you feel there is still a case for this feature.
