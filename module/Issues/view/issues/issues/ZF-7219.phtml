    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_View_Helper_Interface and Zend_View_Helper_Abstract (like action helpers) have method direct().
But it is not used. Method Zend_View_Helper_$helper::$helper is used instead of it. Why?</p>

<p>BTW in action helpers the method Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_$helper::direct() is used but it was not declared in Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Abstract (or in interface).</p>

<p>Can you regulate it?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The abstract has a direct() method for forward compatibility; in 2.0, we plan to use that method instead of using the conventions based approach we currently have (where Foo_View_Helper_Bar requires a bar() method, and which has Zend_View invoking the bar() method). This falls in line better with the Strategy pattern, and makes maintenance and coding easier.</p>

<p>direct() is <em>optional</em> in the action helpers, as action helpers are not required to implement it. direct() is used by the helper broker if the action helper is called as if it were a method call: e.g., $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;redirector('index'). In many cases, action helpers do not have a mappable default behavior nor need one (example: the ViewRenderer primarily functions based on the various controller hooks, and simply has methods to allow setting state -- direct() would have no obvious behavior).</p>
