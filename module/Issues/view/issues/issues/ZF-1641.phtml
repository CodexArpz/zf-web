    <div class="body">
        <p>Filter and validation classes such as Zend_Filter_Alpha are known to make use of the {{/u}} PCRE pattern modifier, but UTF-8 support is not compiled by default into various PHP distributions.</p>

            <p>Original comment by [~cgraefe]:</p>

<p>I can see why this change was made, but for me it is causing problems on certain platforms. On some, the extendes PCRE syntax "\p{}" doesn't seem to match anything. I could quite figure out what exactly is causing this problem. Up to now, I tried the following platforms:</p>

<p>Not working:
Fedora Core 5, PHP 5.1.6, PCRE 6.3
Fedora Core 6, PHP 5.1.6, PCRE 6.6</p>

<p>Working:
Fedora 7, PHP 5.2.2, PCRE 7.0
Solaris 10 x86, PHP 5.1.5, PCRE 6.6
Debian Etch, PHP 4.4.4, PCRE 6.7</p>

<p>Maybe, you could amend the docs to state the exact prerequisites to get Zend_Filter_Alnum et al. to work. That would surely help me a lot.</p>

            <p>I am also have this issue on</p>

<p>RHEL5, PHP 5.1.6, PCRE 6.6</p>

<p>I check redhat default build spec for PCRE 6.6 and --enable-utf8 is specified.  At this point I am not 100% sure it is UTF-8 related but I do know since ZF1.0RC3 the filters Zend_Filter_Alnum and Zend_Filter_Alpha are not matching strings that should be valid.</p>

            <p>These patterns continually fail regardless of the value input:</p>

<p>$pattern = '/[^\p{L}\p{N}' . ($this-&gt;allowWhiteSpace ? '\s' : '') . ']/u';
$pattern = '/[^\p{L}\p{N}' . ($this-&gt;allowWhiteSpace ? '\s' : '') . ']/';</p>

<p>So I modified the pattern to use the old alnum which works both with and without utf-8 specified.  So these patterns are working:</p>

<p>$pattern = '/[^[:alnum:]' . ($this-&gt;allowWhiteSpace ? '\s' : '') . ']/u';
$pattern = '/[^[:alnum:]' . ($this-&gt;allowWhiteSpace ? '\s' : '') . ']/';</p>

            <p>The Unicode property patterns (the ones beginning with {{\p}}) will not work if UTF-8 support is unavailable in PCRE.</p>

<p>From the <a href="">www.pcre.org/pcre.txt</a>" rel="nofollow"&gt;PCRE man pages:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
UTF-8 SUPPORT

       To build PCRE with support for UTF-8 character strings, add

         --enable-utf8

       to  the  configure  command.  Of  itself, this does not make PCRE treat
       strings as UTF-8. As well as compiling PCRE with this option, you  also
       have  have to set the PCRE_UTF8 option when you call the pcre_compile()
       function.

UTF-8 AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT

       From  release  3.3,  PCRE  has  had  some support for character strings
       encoded in the UTF-8 format. For release 4.0 this was greatly  extended
       to  cover  most common requirements, and in release 5.0 additional sup-
       port for Unicode general category properties was added.

       In order process UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE  to  include  UTF-8
       support  in  the  code,  and, in addition, you must call pcre_compile()
       with the PCRE_UTF8 option flag. When you do this, both the pattern  and
       any  subject  strings  that are matched against it are treated as UTF-8
       strings instead of just strings of bytes.

       If you compile PCRE with UTF-8 support, but do not use it at run  time,
       the  library will be a bit bigger, but the additional run time overhead
       is limited to testing the PCRE_UTF8 flag occasionally, so should not be
       very big.

       If PCRE is built with Unicode character property support (which implies
       UTF-8 support), the escape sequences \p{..}, \P{..}, and  \X  are  sup-
       ported.  The available properties that can be tested are limited to the
       general category properties such as Lu for an upper case letter  or  Nd
       for  a  decimal number, the Unicode script names such as Arabic or Han,
       and the derived properties Any and L&amp;. A full  list  is  given  in  the
       pcrepattern documentation. Only the short names for properties are sup-
       ported. For example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl synonym,  \p{Let-
       ter},  is  not  supported.   Furthermore,  in Perl, many properties may
       optionally be prefixed by "Is", for compatibility with Perl  5.6.  PCRE
       does not support this.

        <div class="body">
            <p>From testing on my platforms ( openSUSE/SUSE-OSS 10.0, 10.1, 10.2 ), I have 
the following results:</p>

<p>Up to ( but not including ) apache2-mod_php5-5.2.0-10.rpm testing against the 
PCRE expression in current Zend_Filter_Alnum passes.</p>

<p>From mod_php5 version that ships with openSUSE 10.2 ( 5.2.0-10 ) to the 
current available in the openSUSE build service, ( 5.2.3-29.1 ), testing 
against the pattern fails.</p>

<p>On openSUSE mod_php5-5.2.0-10 and greater is built against the system PCRE 
library and not the PHP bundled one, on opensuse 10.2 this is pcre-6.7-21. 
While  patterns with UTF-8 options match against this system library outside 
of PHP; they do not, for whatever reason match when used inside of PHP.</p>

<p>Workaround, on openSUSE 10.2 an upgrade of the system PCRE to the latest 
available from the openSUSE build service ( pcre-7.1-16 ) will allow pattern 
matching inside of PHP to function as expected.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I forgat about those ..... It should be fixed now. Graham Anderson or anyone else running a none UTF-8 enabled system, could you please run the unit tests for: Zend_Filter_AllTests?</p>

<p>I'll await your response before i close the issue.</p>
