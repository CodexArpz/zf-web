    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The framework currently stores test helpers, test configuration and top level suite in the tests-directory. I want to include the Zend Framework tests in my own test suite, with the following layout:</p>

<p>tests/Zend
tests/
tests/</p>

<p>So every subfolder in tests has its own configuration and test suite and the test suite in tests just mangles together that test suites. Would it be problematic to move TestHelper.php and  TestConfiguration.php.dist to the Zend-subdirectory?</p>

            <p>Please revert this change. It has wide-sweeping impact on the test suites (most individual test classes attempt to include TestHelper.php, and many have requirements based on TestConfiguration.php.dist), and we need to ensure that corrections are made across the entire suite. Additionally, our own CI server was running AllTests -- and this now breaks.</p>

<p>Please do not make sweeping changes such as this one without consulting with the Zend internal team.</p>

            <p>The individual tests were modified to point to the new locations of TestHelper.php and TestConfiguration.php.dist, and AllTests was merged into Zend_AllTests where appropriate.  As noted in the commit message, the unit tests will work if they point to Zend_AllTests instead of AllTests.  I have ran Zend_AllTests for both trunk and release-1.7 and there were no issues related to this change.  I did not make this change in 1.6.2 because people might have to move any customized TestConfiguration.php files they have created under the Zend/ directory.</p>

<p>You posted the following on the mailing list earlier this month:</p>

<p>"I'd like for the community to help us work through the backlog of bugs so we can keep up with new ones easier. :)"</p>

<p>This issue was assigned to Ralph, and Wil gave the go-ahead to fix it as needed.  If this was a Won't Fix, I figured it would have been marked as such in the seven months that it was open.  Given all of this, and the fact that it was on the "popular issues" list, I took the initiative to help out.</p>
