<p>The attachment part is actually a Microsoft issue. Simple way to fix it is to remove the (not required) content-disposition:</p>

            <p>The HTML problem in evolution seems to be related to the Exchange server, getting the mail directly from the mail account works just fine. Testing Outlook without Exchange server soon.</p>

            <p>Agreed - working with Ben, we've discovered the issue is not specific to the client, but more to exchange.</p>

<p>The tests carried out use both evolution and outlook, sitting behind an exchange server. HTML email sent from Zend_Mail exhibits the error, but when accessing POP or IMAP mail via outlook and evolution, there are no problems.</p>

<p>Now to find out what Zend_Mail is doing that exchange is choking on...</p>

            <p>The file contains headers from 4 emails.</p>

<p>All emails were opened in Microsoft Outlook using 2 different accounts - one IMAP, the other behind Microsoft exchange. All examples use the code presented in the initial post.</p>

<ul><li><p>Sending HTML email from Zend_Mail to the account behind exchange doesn't work as intended. The html is sent as an attachment.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending HTML email from PHP's mail function to the account behind exchange works as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending HTML email from Zend_mail to an IMAP account, bypassing exchange, works as intended.</p></li>
<li><p>Sending HTML email from PHP's mail function to an IMAP account, bypassing exchange, also works as intended.</p></li>
</ul><p>So basically, in all the scenarios tried, only the scenario involving Zend_Mail and exchange doesn't work as intended. It appears the content-type and charset declarations are not present when sent from Zend_Mail to the exchange account. Without checking the code, I would assume that perhaps the content type is applied only to the content, not to the entire mail, whereas when sending using PHP's mail function, the content-type and charset are always set for the entire mail.</p>

            <p>Whoops, just to add to the comment above, all tests were carried out with an unpatched Zend_Mail as previous testing determined that the content-disposition issue was not at fault here.</p>

            <p>Reset the priority from "Blocker" to "Minor" since the issue does not seem to be a Zend_Mail, but an exchange problem (i also have the same problem with exchange with other mail sending libraries).</p>

            <p>I have tested this with Outlook 2007 behind an Exchange server and it works correctly with the Inline Content Disposition.</p>
