            <p>The best fixes for this are to either get more memory and/or switch to a different ticketing system.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the performance is worst during the time that the largest number of contributors are on line -- which tells me that we have a load issue. Unfortunately, this is not something that can be fixed in a trouble ticket,but something I need to get budget and or resources allocated for.</p>

            <p>Marking as incomplete, as the status is not resolved, still clearly an issue, but not something to resolve via this channel.</p>
