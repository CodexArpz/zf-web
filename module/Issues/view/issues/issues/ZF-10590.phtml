    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In class Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard in method dispatch() (almost in the end - line 314) there's a call to delete object:</p>

<p>(Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard)
313: // Destroy the page controller instance and reflection objects
314: $controller = null;</p>

<p>When creating object $controller link to this object stored in $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;_actionController</p>

<p>(Zend_Controller_Action)
132: $this-&gt;_helper = new Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker($this);</p>

<p>So it appears that object contains a link to itself. And if we call "$controller = null;" it won't delete the link to object $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;_actionController.
As a result, it doesn't call user controller's __destruct. More precisely, it calls it, but only after script execution is finished.</p>

            <p>You're misinterpreting the rationale. We're simply removing the objects from the scope of the method (which originally contained a loop).</p>

            <p>You've deleted the link to the object. But the object stays in memory as there's another link to this object in itself $controller-&gt;_helper-&gt;_actionController</p>

            <p>You'll note I said "scope of the method", not from memory.</p>

<p>When this code first existed, the action helper broker did not even exist. It's legacy code at best. Additionally, there's some who feel that the controllers should be kept within a registry of the dispatcher, so that if requested multiple times in the same request, the same instance will be retrieved.</p>

<p>Removing it from memory completely or keeping it in a registry at this point would break BC; as such, until ZF2, there's no reason to change the behavior as it currently is.</p>
