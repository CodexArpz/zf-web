    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm using this adapter with MSSQL 2005.  I use listTables() to make sure all the tables I need are in the database but I also have some views I need to check.  There are quite of few things in sysobjects that may be needed by others.  Adding a listDbobjects() method with a parameter to restrict by type would keep the code compact or adding a listViews() for just a list of views would be nice.</p>

<p>It seems like listing all the views would be almost as common as listing tables.</p>

            <p>At this point this is not something that could easily be applied to all adapters.</p>

<p>If you'd like add the idea to the ZF 2.0 page on Zend_Db</p>
