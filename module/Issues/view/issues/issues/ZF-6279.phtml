    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>As described in the summary. 
Zend_Paginator Db_Select should use FOUND_ROWS to setRowCount by default when using Mysqli adapter.
Now it requires hacking the columns and creating a separate select to get it, and in big databases (10M records) this is a huge problem.

            <p>The DbSelect adapter creates a custom COUNT query from the original Db_Select object. In 95% of all queries this works very well and creates a fast enough query. You can specify a custom COUNT query for speeding things up even more. The lack of  a FOUND_ROWS implementation has been a conscious decision on our part.</p>

<p>I would be curious to see what kind of query you're executing and how it performs with the current DbSelect implementation. Could you provide some code for me to look at?</p>

            <p>Why was it conscious? Any argumentation? Because if you implemented methods like listtables (for whatever reason anybody needs that) then for sure there should be something that makes things better, right? :)</p>

<p>Anyway, no code needed. SQL is enough.
SELECT COUNT(d*) AS <code>zend_paginator_row_count</code> FROM <code>m_hotel</code> AS <code>mh</code>
 INNER JOIN <code>m_price</code> AS <code>mp</code> ON mh.trip_id = mp.trip_id WHERE (date between '2009-05-20' and '2009-05-30') AND (date &gt; '2009-04-12');
or
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <code>code</code>) AS <code>zend_paginator_row_count</code> FROM <code>m_hotel</code> WHERE (date &gt; '2009-04-10') LIMIT 3;</p>

<p>this is the thing executed by ZP. The thing is that m_hotel has 10M records (and yes, it has to have them, and yes, it has indexes).
The application works perfectly ok until ZP tries to execute that count query..
Yes, sure I can write my own custom count queries which is a pain if the search query is being built on the fly , but why? 
I mean, the purpose of engine-specific adapters is to provide the features the engines offer, right?
So why do i have to execute two queries instead of one if I have the result in found_rows() function?</p>

            <p>This is not a Zend_Paginator issue, but I encourage you to file a new ticket (not mentioning Zend_Paginator) against Zend_Db to have RDBMS-specific count functionality.</p>
