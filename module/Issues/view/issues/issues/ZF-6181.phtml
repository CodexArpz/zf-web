    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This action helper is mentioned briefly and usage of it to set or disable the layout is shown in the Reference Guide section for Zend_Layout, but that's really all it receives. This is insufficient.</p>

<p>1) The direct() and getLayoutInstance() helper methods to get access to the current layout instance are not mentioned in the Zend_Layout section or the Quick Start Guide. Examples in the former show how to reference variables from layout scripts, but not how to assign them from the controller action method.</p>

<p>2) The Layout helper is not mentioned in the Zend_Controller section on action helpers. Users who might look for it here will come up empty.</p>

<p>3) Finally, because its class name is inconsistent with other action helpers, the Layout helper is also not immediately obvious in the API docs. Most users will check Zend_Layout first, then Zend_Controller_Action, and if they're looking carefully will find it there.</p>
