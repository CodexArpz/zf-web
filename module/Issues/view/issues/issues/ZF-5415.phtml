    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When using Basic Auth in Zend_Auth_Adapter_Http the documents state that the credentials should be base64 encoded, however this is not the case, the code credentials sent through the class are never encoded so never match with that stored in the password file.</p>

<p>From the manual: "In Basic authentication, the credentials field should be the Base64 encoding of the user's password."</p>

<p>The code either needs to be fixed to base64 encode the credentials string before the passwords are checked or the docs need to be updated to state the passwords should be plain text! I believe it would make sense to base64 encode rather than change the docs!</p>

<hr /><p>My auth file (password is "testing" base64 encoded):</p>

<p>admin:test:dGVzdGluZw==</p>

<p>However in the dialog entering "dGVzdGluZw==" as the password authorizes, entering "testing" does not.</p>

            <p>I don't agree (unless I didn't understand your request).</p>

<p>That's is the <em>http client</em> (the browser) that has to base64 encode the credentials, before sending them to the server.
The encoding is then a base64 of <em>all</em> the fields -&gt; login:realm:password.</p>

<p>Zend Basic auth mechanism doesn't have to base64 encode anything, as it already receives a base64 encoded string from the client.
It then base64 decodes it, and tries to make it match with the resolver (a file actually), so your credentials has to be written in plain text in the resolver file.</p>

<p>I think the manual is wrong then, we have to fix it</p>
