            <p>I believe this is due to overloading in the Zend_Test_PHPUnit test suite... and I think it may have been fixed already. Can you please pull from SVN and try running report coverage from there to verify?</p>

            <p>Thanks,  I forgot to test Svn before reporting.</p>

<p>It stopped throwing the exception but the reports are somehow weird and not what they should be.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul><li>the file names of the pages are being generated incorrectly</li>
<li>index.html doesn't contain what it should</li>
</ul><p>I'll come back as soon as I have more information.</p>

            <p>Do coverage reports work normally on non-controller test suites (i.e., the ZF test suite, or your own test suites)? If not, then it's an issue with PHPUnit and/or XDebug. Otherwise, I'll consult with Sebastian to see what could be skewing the coverage creation.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>When the XDebug trace passes through a view script from Zend_View, the filename resolves to something like</p>

<pre class="literal">
<a>zend-view://myfile.php</a>
</pre>

<p>This causes confusion in a PHPUnit function called reducePaths() (PHPUnit/Util/Report.php), which "Reduces the paths by cutting the longest common start path."</p>

<p>So, it will always reduce the path to " " if you use Zend_View and the reports are generated incorrectly.</p>

            <p>That's easy, then. In  your bootstrap process, call:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$view-&gt;setUseStreamWrapper(false);
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you need short tags, add the following flag when calling phpunit:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
phpunit -d "short_open_tags=on" ...
</code></pre>

<p>Both options will disable the stream wrapper, which should fix the coverage reports. (BTW, the stream wrapper will be disabled by default prior to the 1.6.0 final release.)</p>

            <p>I've found it works fine when using the Latest Version of Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase from the Repository. I copied it straight over the version in the 1.6.0RC3 branch.</p>

            <p>Hey Guys,</p>

<p>I think this is still an issue in the final release of 1.6.0. I updated the 1.6.0 release with the version from trunk and it appears to be working correctly again.</p>

<p>The only differences are that the trunk version does a 'require_once' of Zend_Registry and the overloading method (__set) is written as:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if ('_' == substr($name, 0, 1) &amp;&amp; ('__' != substr($name, 0, 2))) {
</code></pre>

<p>as opposed to:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if ('_' == substr($name, 0, 1)) {
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to make the phpunit coverage reports work correctly.</p>
