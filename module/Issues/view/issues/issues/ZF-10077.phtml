    <div class="body">
        <p>I noted this bug in 1.10, then i saw a solved issue for this in 1.9, but i updated to 1.10.6 and the bug still exists.</p>

<p>$currency = new Zend_Currency(array('value'=&gt;100));
print $currency; //Prints '$100.00' - correct is '$ 100.00'</p>

<p>$currency = new Zend_Currency(array('value'=&gt;100));
$currency-&gt;setFormat(array('display' =&gt; Zend_Currency::USE_NAME));
print $currency; //Prints 'US Dollar100.00' - correct is 'US Dollar 100.00'</p>

            <p>As you are referring to US DOLLAR and did not gave additional information I must expect that you are using en_US as locale and therefor USD as regional currency.</p>

<p>According to CLDR the locale en_US refers to the locale en without additional information.</p>

<p>The locale en defines currency representations as "¤#,##0.00;(¤#,##0.00)"
This means that a value like 1000 would be represented as
"$1,000.00".
When en would be represented with a space between currency and number format it would be "¤ #,##0.00" as it is defined in several other locales.</p>

<p>When you want to have a output which is different to the represenation from CLDR you must define your own output format.</p>

<p>Therefor closing as non-issue.</p>

            <p>Ok, i used "en_US" just to give an example, because i did think the output was wrong. If you said there is no space between number and symbol, that's ok for me. However, between currency's name and value should be a space, ain't? Is "US Dollar100.00" correct? Is this output usual?</p>

<p>My real problem is with "pt_BR". In Brazil, the correct is to be a space betwen symbol or currency's name and value.</p>

<p>$currency = new Zend_Currency(array('value'=&gt;100));
print $currency; //Prints 'R$100,00' - correct is 'R$ 100,00'</p>

<p>$currency = new Zend_Currency(array('value'=&gt;100));
$currency-&gt;setFormat(array('display' =&gt; Zend_Currency::USE_NAME));
print $currency; //Prints 'Real brasileiro100,00' - correct is 'Real brasileiro 100,00'</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The locale "pt_BR" defines no informations. It degrades to "pt".
The locale "pt" defines a currency representation of "¤#,##0.00;(¤#,##0.00)".</p>

<p>So also for "pt" no space is defined between currency symbol and currency value. This is regardless of currency symbol, currency abbreviation or currency name.</p>

<p>When you want to use a space then set your own name which includes a space or use your own currency format.</p>

<p>Therefor keeping issue closed.</p>

            <p>Brazil is not Portugal! Each country has its own culture! A space between symbol and value is the usual, at least in Brazil. If some organism defines a non-usual standard, it shouldn't be a standard, and the organism is wrong, ain't? Anyway, i know ZF team is not the responsible for these locale standards. But, at least, you could provide us with the possibility to define we want use the space, by creating a constant like Zend_Currency::USE_SPACE_BETWEEN_SYMBOL_AND_VALUE (true or false), that could be used in toCurrency() method. Can you consider this request?</p>

            <p>There is no differece for the currency definition between the locale brazil and the locale portuguese.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with country or culture... the fact is simply that one definition says "no difference to my root" as both are identical.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, ZF itself allows you already to define your own standard very easily. Look at the available properties of Zend_Currency. This is nothing which has to be considered as it's already supported.</p>

            <p>So, ZF team could consider that we have a bit of confusion here. Maybe the lack of a space between symbol and value doesn't represent a big pratical problem, but, although it's also a standard for the currency definitions, the lack of a space between currency's name and value doesn't make sense. I can't really see anywhere 'US Dollar100.00' can be normal, because they are separated words.</p>
