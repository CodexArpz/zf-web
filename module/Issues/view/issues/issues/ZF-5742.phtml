    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Wildfire_Plugin_FirePhp_TableMessage class has no set/get methods for it's property "rows"</p>

<p>It would be cool to have these methods as we may want to alter the rows previously entered.</p>

<p>This was an issue I had encountered while working on the Zend_Db_Profiler_Firebug. I wanted to alter the table it shows (wanted to add a results column to show the results returning from sql queries), so I extended the Zend_Db_Profiler_Firebug. I did not changed any of the working part (did not alter the queryEnd() part). Once I have fetched my results to an array (as I have called the queryEnd() previously this fetchings does not affect the execution time of the query), I wanted to add these results to the table created by the firebug profiler. But as "_rows" was protected I was unable to get and alter it's data.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the patch. I'll apply it ASAP.</p>

<p>Would you be open to sharing your extended Zend_Db_Profiler_Firebug class? I may be able to incorporate it into a new component I am working on for ZF.</p>

            <p>Of course. Here is the class I extended. It's not much as I did not need a lot of things. Just edited the current row and added a new column to the table.</p>
