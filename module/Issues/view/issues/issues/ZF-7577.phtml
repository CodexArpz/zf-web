    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am unable to use the S3 stream wrapper to retrieve a file whose path, or file name contains spaces, regardless of whether I urlencode\rawurlencode the path first.</p>

<p>To make sure this wasn't an issue in my codebase, I ran a modified version of the test distributed in the full distribution of ZF. I ran it against both versions 1.9.1 and 1.9.0. On line 65 of the test, change the filename to say {{$this-&gt;_fileName = $this-&gt;_bucketName."/test+file.txt";}} or {{$this-&gt;_fileName = $this-&gt;_bucketName."/test%20file.txt";}} . When I run the test, testReadObject fails (all other tests pass). The error message is 
{quote}
1) testReadObject(Zend_Service_Amazon_S3_StreamTest)
Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
expected string &lt;xxx ...snip...&gt;
difference &lt;??? ...snip...&gt;
got string &lt;&gt;
{quote}</p>

<p>I did not test this with other characters that would need to be urlencoded to produce a valid url, though my assumption is that those would fail similarly.
After that, I tried running it without urlencoding the object name (i.e., {{$this-&gt;_fileName = $this-&gt;_bucketName."/test file.txt";}}), and the same test gave an error:
{quote}
1) testReadObject(Zend_Service_Amazon_S3_StreamTest)
Zend_Uri_Exception: Path "/test file.txt" is not a valid HTTP path

            <p>Why put spaces in the first place inside paths/names? (by which I'm not saying this issue isn't legit, but imho it's based on bad practice)</p>

            <p>Every major modern operating system allows spaces in file names, and url encoding provides a standard way to allow the same thing on the web. I didn't test this with other characters that need to be escaped, but my gut tells me that this same error would be present for them.</p>

<p>I'm not arguing that it's a great idea to have spaces in file names; honestly, I don't feel strongly either way. That being said, it should absolutely be possible.</p>

            <p>I was unable to reproduce this.  Please make sure you set the TESTS_ZEND_SERVICE_AMAZON_ONLINE_ACCESSKEYID and TESTS_ZEND_SERVICE_AMAZON_ONLINE_SECRETKEY in TestConfiguration.php.</p>
