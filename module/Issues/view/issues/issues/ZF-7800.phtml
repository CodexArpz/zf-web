    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I have an old code part which uses Zend_Validate::is() to validate form entries (it is pre Zend_Form code). First of all, have a look at it:</p>

<p>if (! Zend_Validate::is($postValue, $v, $validatorArgs, array('My_Validate'))) {
    ...
}</p>

<p>func_get_args() array(4) {
  [0] =&gt; string(2) "02"
  [1] =&gt; string(3) "Int"
  [2] =&gt; array(2) {
    ["min"] =&gt; int(1)
    ["max"] =&gt; int(31)
  }
  [3] =&gt; array(1) {
    [0] =&gt; string(11) "My_Validate"
  }
}</p>

<p>When it comes to validate with "Int", I'll get (with some debugging) the following exception:</p>

<p>The locale '1' is no known locale</p>

<p>This message comes from Zend_Locale::findLocale().</p>

<p>If I see it right, then Zend_Validate::is() calls the __construct() method if available with $args - which would result in the paramater
array(2) {
    ["min"] =&gt; int(1)
    ["max"] =&gt; int(31)
  }
from fun_get_args(). But Zend_Validate_Int needs a locale as parameter for the constructor.</p>

            <p>I have seen that also Zend_Validate_Float __construct() method requires a locale as first parameter - exactly the same behaviour as in Zend_Validate_Int. I think this is the big mistake of this described problem in comparison to Zend_Validate_InArray, _Alpha, _Alnum etc.</p>

            <p>Why do you call the Int validator with properties which are not supported by this validator ?
You would get the same behaviour when you call any other validator which does not support the given options.</p>

            <p>Indeed, I haven't thought about the min/max values. This is part of a form helper which was developed at ZF v1.0 and it is still used so far. I will have a second look at it and will report what I might find out. Seems I'm a bit blind today.</p>

            <p>Ok, here we haven't seen this bug with four eyes - you looked at it once and found the bug. Someone added min/max values to the configuration file of a form and did not add the between validator, which did not fault on ZF 1.7.x and before due to the missing constructor. We have corrected the configs and fixed the code.</p>

<p>Sorry for the double work! I think this issue could be closed.</p>

            <p>Closing as not an issue.</p>

<p>Note that with ZF 1.10 the above usecase will not throw an error in any Zend validator when the parameters are given as array.</p>
