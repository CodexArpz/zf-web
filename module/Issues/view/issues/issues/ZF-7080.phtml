    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>the name attribute was deprecated in version 1.7.3 of the Zend Framework in line with the XHTML spec:  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10</a></p>

<p>however the w3schools reference shows this attribute as still valid: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp</a></p>

<p>My suggestion would be to either alter the $name attribute for the Zend_View_Helper_Form to $id, as the following line:</p>

<p>$this-&gt;_getInfo($name, $content, $attribs)</p>

<p>uses $name as $id if the id is not set in the attributes, or more preferably (if backwards compatibility is required) set the argument to:</p>

<p>$name = null</p>

<p>and add a check to see if it's not null throwing an exception if the if statement is true to stop developers from trying to apply a name attribute.</p>

            <p>w3schools !== W3 Consortium. The official specification is at <a href="www.w3.org">www.w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>Also, an interesting point: the HTML specification actually allows for arbitrary attributes in tags -- which makes expressly forbidding the addition of a "name" attribute a bit moot.</p>

            <p>I do understand that w3schools is not W3 Consortium, I was just pointing this out to show that some users may not understand from using w3schools as to why the cannot add a name to the form tag</p>

<p>Your second comment would to me imply this code is actually broken and invalid.</p>

<p>You cannot add a name tag to a form the way the code currently is, whether that be via the $name variable, or via the attributes.</p>

<p>The $name does nothing now as this is never set on the element due to the code being removed, and via attributes it is removed from the array by $this-&gt;_getInfo as it is expecting name to be set separately and not wanting repeated attributes.</p>

<p>surely if your view is correct we should be allowing developers to add a name tag if they would like one?</p>
