    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The Zend/Locale/Data/ directory contains a number of codeset variants, such as sr_Latn.xml. (Serbian is by default cyrillic).</p>

<p>(1) These variants cannot be used as they are not listed in Zend_Locale::$_localeData[]</p>

<p>(2) I am reliably informed (<a href="http://www.openi18n.org/docs/text/LocNameGuide-V10.txt">http://openi18n.org/docs/text/â€¦</a>) that the correct naming convention for these locales is "sr@latin"</p>

<p>To fix this, I propose</p>

<p>(a) these codeset variants are added to the array</p>

<p>(b) Zend_Locale accepts @latin, @cyrillic, etc. as synonyms for _Latn, _Cyrl, etc.</p>

            <p>When you add a issue then you should also provide a reproducable usecase.</p>

<p>Actually all informations are degraded when they can not be detected.
In this case it means that "sr_Latn" would be degraded to "sr".</p>

<p>You should also note that "codesets" are not part of the "language-region" definition which is needed for Zend_Locale.</p>

<p>There is no component within ZF which would accept codesets until now.</p>

            <p>Sorry - I thought the reproduce case was sufficiently trivial.</p>

<p>$x=new Zend_Locale('sr'); // gives 'sr' - serbian in cyrillic</p>

<p>$x=new Zend_Locale('sr_Latn'); // also gives the cyrillic 'sr' - it should give the latin variant.</p>

<p>The locale sr_Latn.xml exists in the CLDR, and has been imported into /Zend/Locale/Data.</p>

            <p>Once again:
Codesets are not supported by ZF.</p>

<p>There are several other informations available within CLDR which are NOT integrated within ZF. Codesets are just one of this informations.</p>
