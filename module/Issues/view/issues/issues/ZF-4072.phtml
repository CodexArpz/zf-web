    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It is not currently possible to get access to the helper broker instance in use by the current action controller from a class outside it. An example of a use case for this functionality would be an action helper getting access to an instance of a different action helper via its action controller reference.</p>

<p>There are existing methods to accomplish the same purpose, but they involve creating more objects than are really necessary to fulfill the purpose. In the aforementioned example, the action helper could create a new broker instance, passing in its reference to the current action controller. It would seem more prudent, however, to simply use the broker instance that the controller has already instantiated.</p>

            <p>I agree.</p>

<p>See that PHP definitly lacks of  "Package" visibility :-(
That visibility could be used in helpers to get the broker instance back from the actioncontroller , but this same one could'nt be available out of the Zend_Controller scope ( aka, not public ).</p>

<p>Package visibility would also be very usefull in many other situations, particulary in Zend_Controller package.</p>
