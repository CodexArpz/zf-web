    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>View helper url(): in my opionion reset flag set to false by default is OK but only if preserved params are only: module, controller and action. Generation of new url using some custom params from current URL (customerId, etc...) doesn't make much sense for me.</p>

<p>Example: after browsing page customer/view/customerId/3, I click in menu on url('action' =&gt; 'add') and I get this customer/add/customerId/3 ..<br />
This should not happen by default...</p>

            <p>I think in other cases this makes sense: There can be a language or a "skin"-id, which should be carried to over all requests.</p>

            <p>It is related, actually. And it should not be happening with the current codebase from the trunk. I'll write a test for it in order to be 100% sure, though.</p>

<p>The fix will be included in 1.6 as you have asked me to revert the changes from 1.5.2, Matthew.</p>

            <p>Ok, I guess I have misunderstood the issue at first and I think I do this time.</p>

<p>Piotr, you're probably using the default route, which basically means you're using the same route instance to create two distinct URLs. When your route is getting matched it's set a currently matched route and after that it holds matched values to be used on url creation (named assembling in ZF terms). You have two options here:</p>

<ol><li>Fine-tune you're routing schema</li>
<li>Reset default route when creating "new" URL</li>
</ol><p>Ad. 1: This means you can create two distinct routes to handle your application - one for customer viewing and second for adding: '/customer/:action/:id' (which will handle 'customer/edit/1' as well as 'customer/view/1') and '/customer/add'. Then you just use a named route in the url helper. And switching 'action' on first one will work as you expect it to.</p>

<p>Ad. 2: You have an option to reset the route to it's clean state (which just acts like telling the framework 'I need a NEW, clean route here'). But with that option you will have to supply controller parameter instead of supplying action only.</p>
