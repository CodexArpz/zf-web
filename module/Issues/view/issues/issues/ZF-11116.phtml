    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I met a bug on Zend Framework 1.11.3 while using Zend_Config_Writer_Array::write().</p>

<p>This method generates a PHP file containing an array() with all data from an ini file, here is the code from my "public/index.php" :</p>

<p>$config = new Zend_Config_Ini(APPLICATION_PATH . "/configs/application.ini");
  $writer = new Zend_Config_Writer_Array(array("config"   =&gt; $config,
                                               "filename" =&gt; $cache_filename));
  $writer-&gt;write();</p>

<p>In fact, my idea is to create a compiled PHP structure to prevent parsing the "application.ini" file at each execution, next to this I created the Zend_Application with this parameters :</p>

<p>$application = new Zend_Application(
      APPLICATION_ENV,
      $cache_filename
  );</p>

<p>With this code, I have an exception on the default controllers directory wich was not defined.</p>

<p>This is caused by an issue on the Zend_Application class at line 404, the 'php'/'inc' case return the config structure without taking account of the $environment variable (contrary to the other cases, indirectly by $config-&gt;toArray() at line 410), this gives an array incompatible with the rest of the process.</p>

<p>So the only fix I made on my side was at line 404 :</p>

<p>return $config[$environment];</p>

<p>All seems to be ok on my version since this modification.</p>

<p>Best regards,
CÃ©dric Tailly</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Your fix makes the assumption that the configuration file is subdivided internally by the possible values of APPLICATION_ENV, which is not always the case.  If you are using the php/inc suffix on your configuration files then Zend_Application assumes you will create a separate file for each value of APPLICATION_ENV and pass in the proper filename at runtime.</p>

<p>That said, making this change would likely break backwards-compatibility for existing applications, so I would suggest bringing this issue up with the maintainer of Zend_Application (or it's successor) in ZF 2.0 to see if it can be addressed there.</p>
