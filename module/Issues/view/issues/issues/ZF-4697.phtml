    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The two view tests that it breaks are</p>

<p>ViewTests.php -&gt; testGetHelperPath() and testGetFilterPath()</p>

<p>The problem comes in with this code in the PluginLoader load() Method</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
if (class_exists($className, false)) {
    $found = true;
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the break it takes it out of the loop and never creates the $loadFile variable which sets the path to the class.</p>

<p>If you comment out this if statement everything is fine..</p>

            <p>OK I found how this bug is being produced.</p>

<p>If you call a helper by doing $mhc = new My_Helpers_Custom() before calling it from the helperBroker it produces the error.</p>

<p>I'm going to setup a test page and submit it for testing.</p>

            <p>Matthew,</p>

<p>This issue was submitted almost a year ago and I don't think it's valid any more.  I forget what version of PHP I ran this on but it was for the 1.7.0 PR release.</p>

<p>I think this can be closed an a Non-Issue.</p>

 - adds a unit test for this issue
 - uses reflection to get which path the class was loaded from if it is already loaded</p>

            <p>I'm reluctant to use this patch, as Reflection introduces substantial overhead -- and with something used as widely as the PluginLoader, this will have a lot of impact. In looking at your test case and patch, I discovered that we already have the code you describe: in getClassPath(). Since this is a method only used on-demand (not in every request), it makes sense to simply leverage this. Once I looked at that, I realized that I found the flaw: it was in how the $loadFile was detected and cached. I simply removed the logic to cache that information, and subsequently all tests, including your new one, pass.</p>

            <p>The changes made to the PluginLoader make my application crash Apache.
I can't really point my finger on it but if add a simple isset() there is no problem :S</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
...
        if ($this-&gt;_useStaticRegistry) {
            self::$_staticLoadedPlugins[$this-&gt;_useStaticRegistry][$name]     = $className;
            isset($className);
        } else {
            $this-&gt;_loadedPlugins[$name]     = $className;
        }
...

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>@Hendri Actually, no thoughts. The lines you quote were never changed. I actually simply modified the load() method <em>not</em> to store the class filename; instead, it's only retrieved on-demand when you use getClassFile().</p>

<p>Can you provide a reproduce case that demonstrates the behavior? The ZF site itself is using 1.10.2, and we're not experiencing any crashes at this time.</p>
