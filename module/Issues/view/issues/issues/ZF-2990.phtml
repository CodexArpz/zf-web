        <p>Hi,
I am using AjaxContext helper and I think it should be modified to put appropriate headers to not cache content.
Otherwise seems a bit unusable..unless I missed something.</p>

            <p>I need some help; what headers would be useful to you? What configuration options might each need (such as expiration date, etc.)?</p>

<p>Once I have this information I can begin work. Until then, I'm postponing for 1.7 release at the earliest.</p>

            <p>Hi,
I am not really sure what are appropriate headers here as it seems different browsers understand those caching stuff quite differently. In general I think it makes sense not to cache request... (of course configurable will be best). I am currently using component as is... can't say I experienced bad behaviour or something but still.  Just thought that this might be relevant when ajax context.</p>

            <p>Actually... this is something that is probably best done in other places:
* In your view script
* In the action itself, once a context is detected
* In your .htaccess or vhost definition, via mod_expires
* Client-side (Dojo and jquery both have mechanisms for preventing caching of requests, as do others)</p>
