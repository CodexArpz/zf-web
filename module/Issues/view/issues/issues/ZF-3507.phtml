    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently there is no way to use DOM to directly parse an URL. Instead everything is first forced through Zend_Http_Client, which adds overhead and does not leverage the DOM internal magic to handle different encoding types.</p>

<p>Furthermore the DOM is parse once to determine the feed type and then again when the actual parsing takes place.</p>

            <p>Patch introduces a backwards compatibility break by altering the client use. Also, in reality the HTTP client is a more flexible solution (with the obvious perf cost) enabling the even more perf enhancing boost of conditional requests. Since on aggregate the changes would shift the balance to a short term perf enhancement at the cost of that flexibility, the patch will not be applied at this time.</p>

<p>The OP may re-open the issue however (given the age) if they wish to persue a more balanced solution.</p>

            <p>the issue is that using the DOM object directly for loading enables lots of automatic encoding magic that is not available otherwise. this is especially useful when having to deal with (malformed/malencoded) RSS feeds.</p>

            <p>Understood - but regardless it breaks BC, and prevents conditional caching. The patch as is cannot address those points. Given the status of Zend_Feed, the best I can do is revisit it in Zend Framework 2.0 for Zend_Feed_Reader and see if the DOM magic can be integrated without sacrificing flexibility.</p>
