    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I just upgraded from 1.5.0PR to 1.5.0RC1.  I noticed quite quickly that the submit buttons in forms don't seem to display the right text.</p>

<p>Here's some code that I have in a sub-classed Zend_Form constructor:</p>

<pre class="literal">
$eSubmit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('login');
$eSubmit-&gt;setValue('Click to Login');
</pre>

<p>When the form is rendered, the following is output:
````</p>

<p>I haven't put a huge deal of time into trying to figure this one out, but it seems straightforward enough to me.  So, I'm pretty sure it's a legitimate issue.  Whatever the case, it should be easy enough for others to reproduce.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Travis</p>

            <p>A lot changed between the PR and RC1. One of these was how the submit button (as well as reset and button) element works.</p>

<p>The element label is now used as the  value. The rationale behind this is that the label is what is <em>displayed</em> to the end-user. It also provides us with the ability to ensure that what is submitted is actually what we set for the label -- allowing you now call $submit-&gt;isClicked() on your various button elements to create a decision tree.</p>

<p>This functionality is now documented, albeit only in the subversion repository.</p>

            <p>Hi Matthew,</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback.  I appreciate it.  I went and changed from setValue() to setLabel() and all's good, just like you said.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can help me out....is there a change log somewhere that points out the changes from PR to RC1...?  The main download page's changelog link doesn't yield anything.  :-|</p>

<p>Also, I had what I thought was the RC1 docs, but it seems that you're saying that the setLabel() functionality is documented in the subversion repository.  Is that what I get if I download the latest snapshot?</p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Travis</p>
