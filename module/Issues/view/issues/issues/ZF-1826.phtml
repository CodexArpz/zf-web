    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In Measure/Abstract.php, version line as follow (newer than latest nightly? confused but nevertheless, issue exists there too):</p>

<p>@version    $Id: Abstract.php 5786 2007-07-19 18:34:23Z thomas $</p>

<p>Line 187 is as followed:
                foreach ($this-&gt;_UNITS[$this-&gt;getType()][0] as $key =&gt; $found) {</p>

<p>Mathematically correct version would be:
                foreach (array_reverse($this-&gt;_UNITS[$this-&gt;getType()][0]) as $key =&gt; $found) {</p>

<p>Although usually this won't cause an issue because most conversions involve just one operation , if you take for example the conversion from Kelvin to Fahrenheit you will get an erroneous conversion:</p>

<p>$unit= new Zend_Measure_Temperature(10, Zend_Measure_Temperature::KELVIN);
$unit-&gt;setType(Zend_Measure_Temperature::FAHRENHEIT);
echo $unit;</p>

<p>Returns: -809.406 °F
Should be: -441.67  °F (Per <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/temperature.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/temperature.htm</a>)</p>

            <p>Dear "Crouch"...</p>

<p>You are not the owner / maintainer / author or team leader of this class.</p>

<p>Please do not self-assign issues which you are not allowed to.
This is the work of the team leaders or Zend dev team members as they know who the issues are related to.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I thought the "Unassigned" tickets were open for anyone. Which tickets are contributors allowed to work on?</p>

            <p>Hey Luke,</p>

<p>That fixes part of the problem because now it converts TO Fahrenheit correctly. However if you try to convert FROM Fahrenheit with your patch you'll get the wrong value. Try:</p>

<p>Zend_Measure_Temperature(-441.67, Zend_Measure_Temperature::FAHRENHEIT);
$value-&gt;setType(Zend_Measure_Temperature::KELVIN);
$this-&gt;assertEquals(10, $value-&gt;getValue());</p>

<p>The most sensible way to fix this problem is to make Abstract.php do the CORRECT reverse math. This will prevent this from happening later on in the (maybe not likely but possible) case that another measurement is added to Zend_Measure whose conversion formula requires two operations or more.</p>

<p>Besides don't we want to get the conversion perfectly right as oppose to the "It works most the times--almost all the times" type approach?</p>

<p>Thanks for your input however Luke. I myself also am not aware of the exact policy of contributing but am trying to learn it. Hope, like myself, you continue to support this product. :-)</p>

<p>As far as Thomas: I think you should work on your manners. Quoting Mr. Crouch's last name is extremely rude. And from our past interactions, you seem to have a quick "flaming" trigger. Many people are just trying to help and contribute. The way you word your responses could be discouraging. I am sure you are well-meaning but it does not come off that way.</p>

            <p>You are free to add patches to opened tickets.</p>

<p>But the tickets are assigned to people who are owner of the related classes.</p>

<p>And as you may have mentioned you have no "write"-permission to the related classes in the framework. So it's nonsense to have this ticket assigned to as when you can not close it successfully ;-)</p>

<p>As I am the team leader of the related class, and the author and the maintainer it's me who assigns the issues.</p>

<p>Most of the tickets are not so "small"...
But even for the small tickets I would like you to give us/me some days for fixing as we core contributors are not only assigned to one class... myself has to handle about 20 classes. And we always test the changes related to the complete framework with our testbed.</p>

<p>If you want to help it's best to ask the related team leader who can see to give you write access.
Related to "BUG-FIXING" it's better to have small fixes added as comment. This is the fastest way.
You will find the team leader if you look into the wiki for the related class/team.</p>

<p>Anyway... thanks for your help, even if I am also able to have this fixed my own... ;-)
I will take a look into the changes you proposed and run the testbed. If all is ok I will add this to the trunk and the branch.</p>

<p>PS: As you see it's not only "coding"... there is much other work around... sometimes even document the changes in the manual before a commit can take place ;-)</p>

            <p>Sorry if what I have written is not  correct behaviour.</p>

<p>I did not want to hassle anyone. As myself is no english native I am sometimes having problems in responding the correct way.</p>

<p>And I often do not have the time to respond as quick and as complete as I want to.
I will try to do it better in the future... ok ? ;-)</p>

            <p>no worries at all. I was just pretty anxious to dive into helping. if I see some small-ish fixes in the future I'll just suggest the code fixes as comments.</p>

<p>I also now see the real problem in the code. I think I was just cautious of changing the "guts" of Zend_Measure_Abstract::setType() since it's used by so many sub-classes.</p>

<p>thanks for the info; and thanks for being a team lead! I'm a big fan of the framework. keep up the great work, Zend!</p>

            <p>I fixed the related issue with SVN 6040.
And I also added a new feature to define a precision for the generated output.</p>

<p>Please give feedback if the issue is fixed for your environment.</p>

<p>Thnx</p>
