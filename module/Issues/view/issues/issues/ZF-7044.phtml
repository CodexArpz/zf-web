    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I was looking for an HTTP based JSON-RPC client that easily hooked into Zend_Json_Server.  At first, I thought it might already be included as part of Zend_Http_Client, but I couldn't find anything specifically for it.  The core of it seems trivial in nature, though I'd suspect one would want the same results as Zend_Soap_Client and Zend_Rest_Client.</p>

<p>I have attached an example of Zend_Json_Client.  Pretty bare bones stuff which relies on __call(), Zend_Json, and Zend_Http_Client to accomplish simple tasks such as:</p>

<p>$client = new Zend_Json_Client($jsonRpcUri);
$result = $client-&gt;getSqrt(9.0);
echo $result; // 3.0</p>

<p>I apologize if this has already been done elsewhere and my research missed it.  I just thought it would be nice to have a JSON-RPC as a local interface experience.</p>

            <p>This has been brought up before by others, actually. That said... it really needs a full formal proposal as it's a fairly large new feature. If you would like to spear-head this feature, please take a look at our proposal process and submit! :)</p>
