    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Currency variables should be protected, not private. Currently they are all private so the class is not extendable at all, thus useless for advanced usage.</p>

            <p>Not all of these variables are allowed to be protected. There is a reason why some variables are private.</p>

<p>I was already reworking the whole class.
Now I have to rework my already made changes which have taken two days.</p>

<p>Please ask always before reassigning any issue already assigned to another person.
Thank you.</p>
