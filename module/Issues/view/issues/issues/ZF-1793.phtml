    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have just begun to use Zend_Auth.  For now, my implementation consists of descending directly from Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable.  In my class, for simplicity's sake, I simply pass the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable constructor hardcoded parameters describing the DB, columns, and treatment.</p>

<p>Like any good developer...  ;-) ...I wrote a handful of unit tests around my simple subclass.  I pass in various combinations of the following: valid username, valid password, invalid username, invalid password.  All worked well.</p>

<p>So, this morning, I decided to build some tests that would add whitespace to one end, the other, or both of the valid username and password.</p>

<p>This test failed:
            $this-&gt;_auth-&gt;setIdentity($this-&gt;_username . ' '); // $this-&gt;_auth is my Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable descendant....
            $this-&gt;_auth-&gt;setCredential($this-&gt;_password);
            $result = $this-&gt;_auth-&gt;authenticate(); /* @var $result Zend_Auth_Result */
            $this-&gt;assertNotNull($result);
            $this-&gt;assertEquals($result-&gt;getCode(), Zend_Auth_Result::FAILURE_IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND); // The actual result code is Zend_Auth_Result::SUCCESS...</p>

<p>Now, I'm not sure if this is really a problem with Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable or if it's a problem with the quoteIdentifier() functionality.  But whatever the case, it seems to allow "validUsername" and "validUsername ".  If the (white)space is prepended rather than appended, then it does appear to fail as expected.</p>

<p>I can guess that there may be some debate over whether or not whitespace should be automatically trimmed off of the end of usernames.  I would be very much against that.  I would argue that the identity should match exactly what the user has typed in and submitted.  Any deviation and it's invalid.</p>

<p>I typically don't submit bugs unless I'm quite certain I haven't missed anything.  But, I'm a little less certain in this case than I usually am simply because Zend_Auth is fairly new to me.  So, please double-check my findings.  :-)</p>

<p>Also, although I haven't checked this with 1.0.1, I don't remember anything in the change log that would appear to have anything to do with this.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Travis</p>

            <p>Are you using a database that automatically trims trailing whitespace in data returned from queries? I recall running into a similar issue with MySQL once upon a time. Maybe it's actually the database that is trimming the trailing whitespace?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.  I'm using MySQL 5.0.27.  I didn't consider that the DB might be contributing to this problem.</p>

<p>Without knowing too many more details, I'd say that if this can be controlled by the PHP code, then that would be the way to go.</p>

<p>I just opened up MySQL Query Browser and determined a few things:
 - The username field I have defined is VARCHAR(16).
 - I added a row with username = "travis", and selecting where username = "travis " returns that row.</p>

<p>So, it does seem to have more to do with the DB than with the PHP code.</p>

<p>I would still argue that if behavior is different across RDBMSs, then perhaps "we" ought to consider accounting for that in the PHP code such that the behavior is consistent and we get the results we expect and want.</p>

<p>That's what I found out and my two cents....for whatever that's worth.  ;-)</p>

<p>For now, though, I'll read through the link you posted and see if I should change to CHAR() instead of VARCHAR() here and elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>One more thing....The following SQL statement ALSO returns a row:
 - select * from users where trim(username) = "travis ";</p>

<p>This is absolutely NOT what I would expect.  I'm not sure I know what should be done in this case.</p>

<p>Anyway, I figured I ought to add this info to this issue.</p>

            <p>I am sure bill [~bkarwin] would know better, b/c it seems mysql has had some conflicting policies on whitespace between 4. and version 5.</p>

<p>I can confirm this behavior (that TRAILING only) whitespace is ignored when using column = notation.</p>

<p>The whitespace before the value is kept though.</p>

            <p>The issue is that in MySQL, the {{=}} comparison operator ignores trailing whitespace by default.  You can override this in MySQL by using the {{BINARY}} operator before the comparison expression.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
SELECT 'travis' = 'travis'; -- returns 1 as expected

SELECT 'travis ' = 'travis'; -- returns 1, despite one having a trailing space

SELECT BINARY 'travis ' = 'travis'; -- returns 0 
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-binary-op.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/â€¦</a></p>

<p>The {{BINARY}} operator is not standard SQL, it's a MySQL extension.  Other RDBMS brands do not support this operator, and they resolve comparisons of trailing spaces differently.</p>

<p>{{TRIM()}} is one of the few SQL functions that is actually in the SQL standard, so all RDBMS brands <em>should</em> support it.  Unfortunately, Microsoft SQL Server doesn't!  You have to use {{LTRIM(RTRIM(expr))}}. This is supported in all other RDBMS brands supported by Zend_Db.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$dbSelect = $this-&gt;_zendDb-&gt;select();
$dbSelect-&gt;from($this-&gt;_tableName, array('*', $credentialExpression))
$identityColumn = $this-&gt;_zendDb-&gt;quoteIdentifier($this-&gt;_identityColumn);
$identityColumnExpr = "LTRIM(RTRIM($identityColumn))";
$dbSelect-&gt;where("$identityColumnExpr = LTRIM(RTRIM(?))", $this-&gt;_identity);
</code></pre>

            <p>Given that one should be filtering input anyway, doesnt that make a good case for doing the trim() in the action controller before handing off the identity to the actual adapter?</p>

<p>I am inclined to close this issue as "not an issue" if no compelling argument can be raised against "filtering input" before sending to the adapter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, much like there is a credential treatment, we could add an identity treatment as well if an argument can be made for it.</p>

            <p>The problem with filtering the identity input is that it doesn't filter the other side of the comparison in the SQL statement.  That is, the left hand side of the comparison references a column, which may also contain space-padded strings.</p>

<p>If Zend_Auth also provided methods to create entries in the directory against which it authenticates, it could performs a {{trim()}} in PHP code prior to inserting identity values into the directory.  Then you could assume that identities in the directory are not space-padded strings.  But as I understand it, Zend_Auth does not provide methods to create directory entries.  Of course you could still make the same assumption, that identities stored in the directory are <em>not</em> space-padded, but Zend_Auth has no way of assuring this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>This ticket had dropped off my radar....then, all of the sudden, activity...!  ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to toss another two cents in....</p>

<p>I agree with Ralph to a point.  However, when it comes to authentication, then I'm of the opinion that one takes precisely the input that has been supplied by the user.  Some people consider usernames and/or passwords case-insensitive, so they will typically change the case to all upper or all lower case before inserting, updating, or comparing.  I suspect that some people would consider usernames and/or passwords as whatever the user has entered less the white-space on either side.  Perhaps I'm alone, but that's not my approach with usernames/passwords.  Rather, I think one should (typically) take exactly what they've typed and see if there's a match.  I would think that when one starts to filter or modify the usernames/passwords prior to authenticating the information, then it seems like it makes the whole authentication "barrier" a little less secure.  (Please keep in mind that I'm not a security or authentication expert.)</p>

<p>So...while still on or near the fence, I think that I would prefer to see some changes to Zend_Auth to address such situations....especially if it's possible on MySQL, the DB of choice, so to speak, for a great deal of PHP developers.</p>

<p>But, I certainly won't be heartbroken if no one else agrees with me.  It will bug me a bit, but I think I could eventually get used to the idea of filtering or not allowing starting or trailing whitespace.  ;-)</p>

<p>OK.  That's my two cents here.  Now I've gotta go deposit another two cents regarding the upcoming Zend_View "concrete placeholder implementations"....  :-)</p>

<p>Take care...</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>From an application standpoint (specifically a web application where everything in http is a string to start), having whitespace before and after a username doesn't change who the user is presenting themselves to be.</p>

<p>Perhaps that mysql was developed with the web in mind or perhaps, they were tired of seeing extraneous whitespace enter the database and take up unnecessary space.  Either way, I'm on the side of the fence that if an application wants to strictly check users for trailing/leading whitespace, they might want to do that at the controller level where they can filter before passing to the adapter.</p>

<p>Also, since its specific to mysql, I'm not sure i see a way of adding trimming to the adapter and assuring that the user actually got into the database trimmed as well (across all applications and all database flavors).</p>

<p>Is it ok if I close this as "wont fix" or "not an issue" for now?</p>

            <p>Ralph,</p>

<p>Thanks for your latest comments.</p>

<p>I'm not sure who you're asking there at the end, but if you're asking me, then here's my answer: yes, it's fine with me to close this as "won't fix" or "not an issue".  Like I said, I won't be heartbroken.  ;-)</p>

<p>I think that I'm right in considering people like you more experienced than I am and if you guys are comfortable trimming the whitespace off a username prior to submitting it to the auth component, then I'm comfortable with that, too.  :-)</p>

<p>Thanks again for the debate.</p>
