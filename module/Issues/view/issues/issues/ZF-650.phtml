    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>We currently have in the product two components, Zend_Service_Rest in the core library, and Zend_Rest_Client in the incubator, which appear to do the same thing (though their code is not identical).</p>

<p>It would seem that Zend_Rest_Client conforms with our naming convention, and is an appropriate sibling of Zend_Rest_Server.  This matches the pairings of Zend_XmlRpc_Client/Server, and Zend_Http_Client/Server.</p>

<p>However, Zend_Rest_Client extends Zend_Service_Abstract, and Zend_Service_Rest does the same.  Many of the Zend_Service classes for specific web services utilize Zend_Service_Rest.</p>

<p>We should discuss this and come up with the right solution, and keep one class but not both.  Having two classes that both implement a REST client is confusing and risks divergence of functionality.</p>

<p>If we choose to keep Zend_Rest_Client, then once it graduates to the core library, other Zend_Service classes must be updated to use this class name instead of Zend_Service_Rest, and that latter class should be deleted from the product.</p>
