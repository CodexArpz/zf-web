    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It would be useful to be able to pass an array of decorators (or indeed, options) to the individual radio buttons making up a Radio element.  Perhaps treating each radio button as it's own element would allow this, with Form_Element_Radio instantiating each button element and passing it options.</p>

<p>My motivation for suggesting this is that my designer has requested radio layout like:
</p>

<p>The standard radio elements enforce layout like .</p>

<p>In order to achieve the altered layout, I've had to subclass Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_RadioButton, Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_RadioButton, Zend_Form_Element_Radio, and Zend_View_Helper_Radio, all of which are essentially cut-and-paste copies of the original's render method with a line or two altered.</p>

<p>I also think it could clean the code up a lot to handle radios with their own decorators.</p>

            <p>Hi Matthew,</p>

<p>Does it currently exist a way to reach this goal (ability to apply decorators to each option) ?
If there is an alternative way that could be great to know it, by waiting an improvement which will be simpler to use.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
