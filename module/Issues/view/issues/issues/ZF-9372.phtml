    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>With any of the other Routers you can use them in conjunction with a Front Controller Plugin and hook into the routeShutdown to do any modifications that you need.  For some reason Zend_Rest_Router does not return the expected results in the array.</p>

<p>For instance.
If I make the request domain.com/2.0/products/11 and I use a standard router I get the following array back</p>

<p>array(
   'module' =&gt; '2.0',
   'controller' =&gt; 'products',
   'action' =&gt; 'get'
)</p>

<p>However it seems that Zend_Rest_Route validates the module/controller/action against the dispatcher which is something all of the other routes do not seem to do and i get results like the following:</p>

<p>array(
   'controller' =&gt; '2.0',
   'action' =&gt; 'get',
   'module' =&gt; 'default',
   'products' =&gt; 11
)</p>

<p>In my case I am trying to hook into the routeShutdown() method so that I may change the version number (module) to be m2m0 as you cannot have modules starting with numbers or with periods in them at all.</p>

<p>I have tried using a regular route and chaining it to the rest router but that goes against rest practices and I could not get it to work chaining in either direction.</p>

<p>As a work around I have had to extend Zend_Rest_Route and override the match() method.  However due to the nature of how the match method works I unfortunately had to duplicate the entire method: <a href="http://pastebin.com/1F88qaQQ">http://pastebin.com/1F88qaQQ</a></p>

<p>The only lines I actually changed are lines 32-36.</p>

<p>There should be a way to accomplish this with the Zend_Rest_Route as there is with all of the other routers.</p>
