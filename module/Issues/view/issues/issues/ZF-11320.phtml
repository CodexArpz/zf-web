    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When reading a message using Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap or Zend_Mail_Storage_Pop3, I am unable to see any from addresses and most to addresses. This can be seen in the raw headers that it outputs. I don't know enough about the underlying protocols to debug but am happy to run tests if that would help narrow down the cause.</p>

<p>Also, I know that this information is contained in the emails (they aren't corrupted or anything) because I was able to connect to the same server using IMAP in Thunderbird and view all of the information including email addresses.</p>

            <p>I ran another test on this today and I was able to view the email addresses. I think maybe it was a server configuration issue. You can close this ticket.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I'm experiencing this issue. My environment is:
Debian Squeeze
Apache2.2
PHP/5.3.3-7+squeeze1
CakePHP + Zend Framework
Zend_Mail</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
// $message instanceof Zend_Mail_Part
$recipient = implode($message-&gt;getHeader('to', 'array'));

// $recipient never contains the email address found in the less than '&lt;', greater than '&gt;' brackets.
</code></pre>

<p>For example, if the header contains <a href="mailto:doug@somedomain.com">doug@somedomain.com</a> then I get nothing. Or if it contains "Doug R"  <a href="mailto:doug@somedomain.com">doug@somedomain.com</a> then I get "Doug R"</p>

<p>Corey said it is a server config issue. Could you tell me what can be changed in the environment to fix this?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I don't know-- I'm not in control of the server. It would be really nice to know what is causing this bug though, in case it happens again.</p>

            <p>Ok, think i've found it.</p>

<p>Trick is that CakePHP developers have done their job and prevent somebody malicious entering in nefarious tags by cutting out anything with '&lt;' and '&gt;' in it. Basically anything that looks like a tag is removed. The headers are saved to the DB but stripped out when retrieved.</p>

<p>Definitely not a Zend_Mail bug.</p>

<p>If anyone wanders into this that's using CakePHP, the relevant section is highlighted in yellow at the top of this page:
