    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In 1.8.4, doing something like this in a view:</p>

<p>echo $this-&gt;filteringSelect(
'select',
'20',
array(
'store' =&gt; 'store',
'storeType' =&gt; 'dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore',
'storeParams' =&gt; array('url' =&gt; '/my/data'))
);</p>

<p>Fails, the 'value' is not set because the store is not loaded when it it parses the input. With a filteringSelect the input remains a textbox with the value set, but it is not a dojo object, and everything else on the page breaks. With a comboBox the value and label are set to the identifier value that I am passing instead of the label getting set properly (assuming because combo box allows things not in the store). I tried putting a 'value' option in the params array, but that doesn't seem to propagate, and even if I test this by hand it still doesn't load properly because of the way things are getting parsed.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea's? Besides creating all this stuff by hand?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The following scenarios work:
* Declarative usage
** If the store is already defined prior to parsing, and the widget references the jsId of the store, then the value will be set.
** If the store is already defined prior to parsing, but the widget does not define the store and the store is manually added to the widget following parsing, the value will <em>not</em> be set.
** If the store is already defined prior to parsing, but has no jsId, there's no way whatsoever to associate it with the widget; the value will <em>not</em> be set.
* Programmatic usage
** The store <em>must</em> be set and added as part of the widget declaration for the value to be set (i.e., added as an object, not as a string referencing the jsId)
** Any other situation will result in no value being set</p>

<p>Thus, the only way for this to work is for the store declaration to happen prior to onLoad, and for the store declaration to define a jsId.</p>
