    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I am using setPublishedDate on the _header of a Zend_Feed_Builder_Interface object. It should have no effect on the Atom feed, as the published element is only valid for an individual entry, not for the whole feed (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.9">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.9</a>) However, the  tag is written for the feed, causing validation to fail.</p>

            <p>I would recommend trying Zend_Feed_Writer, currently available from trunk, and releasing with 1.10.0 later this month (a beta will release today). Its support for Atom is comprehensive and follows the specification.</p>

            <p>Good to know, thanks.</p>

<p>I can't try the new version, but if it's following the spec, then I'm happy.</p>

            <p>Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend_Feed_Reader/Zend_Feed_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.</p>
