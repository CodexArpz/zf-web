            <p>I dont really understand your problem...</p>

<p>setWeekday uses WEEKDAY_8601... the ISO format... ISO defines 1 as Montag and 7 as Sunday.
All setxxx functions work with ISO format.
getWeekday returns a DATE OBJECT and no string.</p>

<p>The ordinary toArray function returns the date as array where the weekday is treated as WEEKDAY_DIGIT which is like PHP's 'w' token.</p>

<p>Btw:
When you give an array as input the weekday is used as WEEKDAY_DIGIT like with toArray.</p>

            <p>Yes, that's the point. ISO weekday is not used as PHP's.</p>

            <p>Sorry... I still don't see the problem.</p>

<p>Input format's always differ depending on the way you use...
As already said:
Array = GNU Format
setXX = ISO Format
getXX = Date Object</p>

<p>ISO defines 1 as monday and 7 as sunday
GNU defines 0 as sunday and 6 as saturday</p>

<p>We can't say that 7 is ok for GNU format and we can also not say that 0 is ok for ISO.
These rules are defined through the standards.</p>
