    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Perhaps in the version 1 of the JSON-RPC spec this was the correct method. However, in version 2 of JSON-RPC:</p>

<p>error
This member is REQUIRED on error.
This member MUST NOT exist if there was no error triggered during invocation.</p>

<p>I've made my client work around this rather than altering the ZF code, but it would nice to have Zend_Json_Server conform to the spec.</p>

            <p>I see in ZF-8757 that the patch included is to deal with both version 1 and 2 responses. Hopefully that is the case. If so, this issue is somewhat of a duplicate and can be closed.</p>
