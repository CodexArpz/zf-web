            <p>Dmitry, could you please review this issue? I believe Luke has a patch that may be suitable for immediately committing to trunk.</p>

            <p>Luke, could you provide a test case for the bug. Some small piece of PHP code that produce invalid output (and the expected output).</p>

            <p>This is a file which presents the problem with Zend_OpenId::bigNumToBin when used with the gmp library.</p>

<p>The integer described is outputed differently than it should be.  I believe this to be a problem with the way gmp_strval() is interacting with pack(), but I'm not entirely positive.  Substituting with a slightly slower mod+div option of reconstruction the bytes of the big num in a binary packed string works fine.</p>

<p>The way this surfaces in the existing consumer code is that a consumer will sporadically but often (like 50% of time or more) fail to associate properly with a IdP because it doesn't reconstruct the secret properly coming out of computeDhSecret.</p>

<p>Substituting the included gmp conversion code in Zend_OpenId_bigNumToBin2 has caused our associations to occur without problems.</p>

<p>A note about the code's provenance: I copied it over and adapted it from JanRain's code.  They've given permission for it to be included in ZF, but their code is licensed under Apache 2.0, so I'm not sure about the compatibilities with ZF.</p>
