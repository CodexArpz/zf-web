    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Matthew, your blog posts on using Models in an application are great. In fact, I think posts like that need to be compiled into an entry for the ZF reference manual under the chapter Zend_Model (just to let people know where to find it, even though there's no concrete Zend_Model implementation).</p>

            <p>Please also write that neither Active Record, Table Gateway or Data Mapper are models, but Transaction Script, Table Module and Domain Model (only in conjunction with Server Layer) are.</p>

<p>How come that those 3 patterns are never mentioned in the model debate? although even fowler discusses them in great length as patterns of the domain logic.</p>

            <p>Ben -- our QuickStart actually uses (and names it as such!) the Table Module pattern, and I specifically mention Transaction Script and Domain Model in my blog posts. :)</p>

<p>Active Record, Table Data Gateway, and Data Mapper are all data access patterns. That's definitely one thing I've been trying to get across in my blog series.</p>
