        <p>Talking about conventions, the correct name should be Zend_Layout::getInstance(), not Zend_Layout::getMvcInstance(). I suggest to make that method deprecated and clone it to Zend_Layout::getInstance().</p>

<p>It's that huge because Zend Studio has automatically removed whitespaces at the end of lines, nevermind.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you could explain the rationale behind this feature suggestion?</p>

<p>The current purpose of getMvcInstance() is to ensure that when using Zend_Layout with the MVC, the plugin and action helper are registered; since getMvcInstance() returns null when startMvc() has not been called, it's an easy way to check whether or not layouts are currently active within the MVC layer (i.e., that the plugin and action helper are registered). Additionally, Zend_Layout instantiation requires minimally the layout view script path, which allows us to use getMvcInstance() with no arguments (since startMvc() takes care of this requirement).</p>

<p>How do you propose to meet these requirements with your patch?</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>This patch meets these requirements already, it is just a suggestion to follow naming conventions.  Are you saying that the MVC instance is separate enough from Zend_Layout to require a distinctly named getMvcInstance() method?</p>

            <p>Well, I think the fact is that Zend_Layout can act with or without MVC.
So getMVCInstance() is named so that you remember the object returned is properly registered to the MVC layer and should be used with it.</p>

<p>getInstance() would let me think that Zend_Layout is a singleton, it's definitly not, but it can be looked at a "MVC singleton", that's more meaningfull.</p>

            <p>I've done quite a bit of thinking on this, and feel that the method is named correctly. As noted in the comments and on #zftalk, getInstance() implies a singleton. Zend_Layout is not a singleton, but the various aspects of the  MVC need access to the same instance of a layout object in order to ensure they all work together. getMvcInstance() correctly implies this behavior.</p>
