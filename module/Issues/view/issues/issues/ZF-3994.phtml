        <p>Lucene optimize() consumes 64M (or more) when optimizing indices created with stock settings in ZF 1.6.0 RC2.</p>

<p>Data was originally total 71,000 items, around 36MB total size after indexing with stock Lucene settings.  After setting memory_limit = 128M in /etc/php.ini and then re-running ZSL-&gt;optimize(), the resulting single index file ("_2eaw.cfs") is 31,798,340 bytes.  If memory_limit = 64M in php.ini, then ZSL-&gt;optimize() bombs.  Following two messages appeared:</p>

<p>This first message appeared when memory_limit = 64M and before it was increased to 128M allowing optimization to succeed:</p>

<p>{quote}
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1024 bytes) in /var/www/SHARED/ZEND_FRAMEWORK/ZendFramework-1.6.0RC2/library/Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php on line 1591
{quote}</p>

<p>This second message appeared after optimize() succeeded (when memory_limit = 128M) and another item was added to index and memory_limit was reset to 64M in php.ini, followed by attempt to optimize() again:</p>

            <p>This is actually a serious issue and affects all versions of ZF that include Lucene.</p>

<p>When building large indexes, and then running the optimize() method, PHP will throw a "Allowed memory size of ... bytes exhausted".  Since the PHP process has a set memory limit, and your index file needs to be loaded into memory for Zend Search Lucene to handle it, the ratio seems to be about 2:1 memory_limit value to index size, in order to prevent memory exhaustion.</p>

<p>There's probably a better way to construct the optimize() method to handle optimizing the index files, however I do not have time atm to fix this for the community.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if anyone has found a work around for the problem, but if you are working with a very large index, say 500MB+, I have found the easiest solution is to setup a separate web service running Apache Solr and using the dataimport handler to build/maintain the indexes.</p>
