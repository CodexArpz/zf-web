    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I have an action that posts data to a blogger account. The actual action works fine, but with zend framework versions 1.8.2 and 1.8.3 I have an error message announcing that there are files missing for Zend_Loader.</p>

<p>Here are the files it is looking for:</p>

<p>Zend/Gdata/Kind/Entry.php
Zend/Gdata/Kind/Title.php
Zend/Gdata/Kind/Content.php</p>

<p>Oddly, the problem does not affect Zend 1.8.1 (and presumably below) only versions 1.8.2/3. Also, the actual action works great (data is posted to the blog etc...), it is almost as if there is an error for no reason.</p>

<p>Just top confirm, the library/Zend directory(s) and files are completely un-modified, so the installation is stock.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

Can you provide some more information? What are you calling that's causing this, and what is the exact error text that's returned?</p>

            <p>Matthew,
I think this may be a problem with your installation. I'm not able to reproduce this.</p>

<p>I've attached a test case here that calls all of the functions you listed without problem: [^zf7013-test.php]</p>

<p>For now, I'm going to close this issue with resolution "cannot reproduce". However, if you can provide a modified test case which demonstrates this problem, feel free to leave a followup comment and I'll re-open this.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Trevor,</p>

<p>As requested, I am posting here because of a similar problem. The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    $username = 'user@example.com';
    $password = 'password';
    $domain = 'example.com';
    $userToSearchFor = 'tester';
    $conn = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($username, $password, Zend_Gdata_Gapps::AUTH_SERVICE_NAME);
    $gapps = new Zend_Gdata_Gapps($conn, $domain);

    $this-&gt;view-&gt;user = $gapps-&gt;retrieveUser($userToSearchFor);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to use the Gapps API and access the Provisioning API of Google Apps. The Provisioning API is available on Premier and Education editions of Google Apps.</p>

<p>The warning message is displayed below. I'm using version 1.8.4 of the framework. Previously when I was in version 1.7.8, this message did not appear. I switched the Gdata library folder from 1.7.8 into 1.8.4 and the warning message did not appear as well.</p>

<p>Warning: include(Zend/Gdata/Gapps/Extension/UserQuery.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/cheeze/public_html/zend/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83</p>

            <p>I am having essentially the exact same issue as Chee How</p>

<p>trying to access the Google Provisioning API, using  virtually identical code, and am getting the same error:</p>

<p>Warning: include(Zend/Gdata/Gapps/Extension/UserQuery.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/cheeze/public_html/zend/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83</p>

<p>As a temporary workaround, I've copied the UserQuery.php file into the Extensions directory, which seems to work, but I can't understand why the loader is looking there to begin with.</p>

            <p>Experimenting further, it seems that, at least in my case, UserQuery <em>is</em> actually being found (I can use retrieveUser function perfectly), but the warnings still persist.</p>

<p>Could the Loader be looking for the file in two different places?</p>

            <p>For those of you who are experiencing this problem:</p>

<p>Please attach a <em>complete</em> test case that reproduces this, including calls to Zend_Loader. See this file as an example: [^zf7013-test.php]</p>

<p>Also please let me know when output you run the above test case, and the the output from {{phpinfo()}} (or {{php -i}} from the command line).</p>

            <p>It looks like this problem occurs in the release-1.8 branch, but not in trunk.</p>

<p>Since the 1.9 branch is going to be cut soon, I'm not going to bother to backport the fix for this to the release-1.8 branch (unless I hear that there's going to be another 1.8.X release). In the meantime, please download a development snapshot from here to fix this:</p>
