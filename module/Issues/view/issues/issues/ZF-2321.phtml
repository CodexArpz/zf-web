    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>If a different decimal separator is used thanks to locale:</p>

<p>$select-&gt;where('floatCol = ?', 1.234);</p>

<p>will produce:
WHERE floatCol = 1,234</p>

<p>in place of:
WHERE floatCol = 1.234</p>

<p>I think it would be interesting to run the testsuite with different locales.</p>

            <p>Using native PHP and Zend_Translate-&gt;setLocale();</p>

<p>First:
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'fr_BE.UTF-8');</p>

<p>And some lines after:
$i18n = new Zend_Translate('gettext', $languageDir . 'en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'en');
$i18n-&gt;addTranslation($languageDir . 'fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'fr');
$i18n-&gt;addTranslation($languageDir . 'nl/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'nl');
...
$i18n-&gt;setLocale('fr');</p>

<p>In any case, it should be easy to fix with sprintf('%F', $float);</p>

<p>%F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.</p>

            <p>You should not rely on setlocale() as it's not secure in multithreaded environments.</p>

<p>Using components from the I18N core you must set your locale to UTF-8 or use Zend_Locale.</p>

<p>Changing the locale within your scripts is not secure. What if your have 2 users which run through this code almost the same time ?
The first set's UTF8 runs through the translation. The second set's UTF8, then the first unsets UTF8.
Now the second run's through a I18N component WITHOUT HAVING THE LOCALE SET AS SET BEFORE !!</p>

<p>Related to the original problem, it is also possible to use Zend_Locale_Format to get a normalized locale unaware notation of numbers. Zend_Locale itself was designed to be aware of such problems and locale overall notations.</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas - I think the setlocale() is shown purely to help reproduce the bug.</p>

<p>Regarding Zend_Locale in this context - I was keen to provide a solution using only sprintf('%F', $value) as shown as it reduces the dependencies within the Zend_Db component. But it's good to know from a developer perspective that Zend_Locale can do this. Cheers</p>

            <p>We exclusively use non-multithreaded environments and most of the time I suggest using core php functions over functions written in PHP.
The bug here was not related to Zend_Translate at all, I mention it just because of Simon's #1 question.</p>

<p>By the way, I am really disappointed it tooks 5 months to ask me for more information for such an easy bug to resolve.
I hope it's not the reflect of Zend's strategy to promote their Zend Framework Support.</p>
