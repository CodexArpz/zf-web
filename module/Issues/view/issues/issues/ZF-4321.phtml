    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Paginating Zend_Search_Lucene results is something that's in fact already supported through the Iterator (or perhaps even the Array) adapter. However, it might be worth investigating if a specialized Lucene adapter would provide some benefit when paginating search results. For example, result caching would be a welcome feature. Alexander's email about the workings of ZSL and the Zym_Search_Lucene implementation (which supports caching) could be used as reference.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>After a (short ; ) discussion with Alexander the decision has been made to look at providing ZSL with a caching mechanism. Therefor a specialized adapter would be redundant. Instead, a section in the manual should be added on how to efficiently paginate search results.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The addition of an internal Zend_Search_Lucene caching mechanism appears to make any search result caching documentation for Zend_Paginator unnecessary.</p>

            <p>I should add that when such a feature is released, this issue can be reexamined in light of any new information.</p>
