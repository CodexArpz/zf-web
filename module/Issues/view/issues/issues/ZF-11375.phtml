    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The following values are not escaped in Zend_Feed_Atom's {{_mapFeedHeaders()}}:
* {{}} (which uses the {{link}} entry)
* {{}} (both the {{author}} and {{email}} entries)
* {{}} (the {{copyright}} entry)
* {{}} (the {{image}} entry)
* {{}} (the {{generator}} entry)</p>

<p>Most of the other header array entries are either escaped by virtue of being used in {{setAttribute}} or another DOM function that escapes its input, or manually included in a CDATA section. However, the above-listed entries are passed directly to {{createElement}}, which does not escape.</p>

<p>The problem is particularly bad for {{}}, because it uses the {{link}} entry which is also output <em>escaped</em> in a {{}} element. So, if your feed link contains ampersands, there's no way to get it to output correctly. If you escape it yourself, it gets double-escaped when output in the {{}} element, and if you don't escape it, you get DOM warnings and the {{}} element gets cut off.</p>

            <p>Please use Zend_Feed_Writer to create feeds, as its write support is more thorough and well-tested. The original Zend_Feed and Zend_Feed_Builder are deprecated in favor of Zend_Feed_Reader and Zend_Feed_Writer.</p>
