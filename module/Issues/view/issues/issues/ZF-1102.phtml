            <p>Zend_Session could be modified to throw an exception when the specified save_path is not writable.</p>

<p>A lot of people like to set "ini" settings in .htaccess.  We could skip the is_writable check, if save_path was not set using Zend_Session::setOptions().  However, ignoring this group of people would allowing warnings for bogus save_path's set in either php.ini or .htaccess.  Alternatively, a new "no_save_path_test" option could be added to Zend_Session::setOptions(), thus providing a way for developers to explicitly disable the test, if they are not using files for saving their sessions, <em>and</em> do not want to set a valid value for "save_path".  This latter option is not currently planned, since we are not investing extra effort for extreme edge cases yet (pre ZF 1.0).  However, in principle, I do not see a problem with adding this option.</p>

<p>A totally different perspective:  We should not check their PHP ini settings at all in ZF core components .. This is the job for Zend_Environment, which should be executed everytime they change their environment or application configuration settings.
(10:23:18 AM) cleanfunnyjoke: I could go to either of these 2 extreme perspectives .. they both appeal to me.  For high performance situations, I would lean towards using Zend_Environment from a cron job and avoiding the overhead of per-request checks/tests. However, we are not yet at ZF 2.x, Zend_Environment is in incubator, etc. and we want to avoid premature optimizations.</p>

            <p>Sorry for reopening, but fix in r. 4193 is not very good. I use a special session save handler (Zend's Session Clustering mod_cluster) which does not care about the value of session.save_path - so I have no problems starting sessions regardless of the value of this directive, but now I can't use Zend_Session anymore.</p>

<p>In fact - looking at phpinfo() shows I have no value for session.save_path so I am not sure the check is even valid (what is the default if there is no value?)</p>

<p>IMHO we should not try to "rape" the PHP environment by performing our own checks. PHP is <em>ment</em> to show a warning when your session save path is not usable and I don't think we should override that.</p>

            <p>Hi Shahar.  We discussed this specific issue during the last devteam meeting and decided that the few people who are not using the default file-based session handler will simply have to fix save_path by giving it a valid value, even though they might not need a valid save_path.  Some other options were discussed (noted above), but ruled out for now.</p>

<p>Why not set save_path to a valid value?</p>

<p>Allowing PHP to emit warnings for invalid save_path is contrary to our coding standards:

            <p>I see - if the issue was already discussed I see no point in opening it again - although I am not sure it's our job to override warnings emmitted by the PHP engine (not by wrong code in a ZF class).</p>

<p>I will set my session.save_path to something just to override these warnings.</p>

<p>I think this should be documented though.</p>

            <p>Although the devteam voted to not address the case where someone is not using the default files save handler and has an invalid save_path, the patch required seems very small and required very little effort to create.  So I've uploaded an experimental patch.  Please test.  Thanks.</p>
