    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p><a href="http://www.php.net/bbcode">http://www.php.net/bbcode</a> for more information</p>

<p>C code is always (very)better than PHP code. Other classes such as Zend_Json use the C extension of PHP if detected.
I think Zend_Markup_Parser_Bbcode should do the same with ext/bbcode (which can be activated by a simple "pecl install bbcode").
ext/bbcode is marked as stable, more commits informations on its PECL page <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/bbcode">http://pecl.php.net/package/bbcode</a></p>

<p>For that purpose, perhaps Zend_Markup_Parser_Bbcode should be refactored to use internal adapters throught a common interface</p>

            <p>I disagree here. The extension does not fit in any way into Zend_Markup (I think). Besides that, if people want to use this extension, they should do it without Zend_Markup. Again: IMHO.</p>

            <p>The bbcode extension is a complete tokenizer/parser/rendere solution, which is not suitable for Zend_Markup, as the bbcode extension cannot be used to generate a token list. Also, your example with Zend_Json is pretty bad. Zend_Json was created, when there was no native JSON extension in PHP, and it currently only exists for backward compatibility. With Zend Framework 2.0, it will most likely be removed.</p>

            <p>Actually, Ben, your notes on Zend_Json are not entirely true. There are a few features in Zend_Json_Encoder that simply are not present in ext/json, including full unicode support as well as the ability to encode JavaScript lambdas. Additionally, both the encoder and decoder offer flags for treating objects/assoc arrays differently -- again, something ext/json does not offer. As such, we likely won't be deprecating it in 2.0.</p>
