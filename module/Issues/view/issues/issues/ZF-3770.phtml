    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The setter methods of Zend_Uri currently return string values, not Zend_Uri, which is undesirable and inconsistent within the framework. The setter methods of an object should return the object on which the setter was called, permitting additional method chaining. Zend_Uri returns the value overwritten by the current set operation.</p>

            <p>While I agree with this change, it would break backwards compatibility so it might not be wise to do before ZF-2.0 (in which I suggest a full rewrite of Zend_Uri).</p>

            <p>It would be interesting to note if anyone is actually using the current functionality of the class, and I'd love to hear the use case for it. I don't necessarily agree that a complete rewrite of the class is necessary (most of the logged issues seem to revolve around improving the regex validation), even if the return values are altered in a minor version. Maybe I'll take it up as a proposal on the wiki...</p>
