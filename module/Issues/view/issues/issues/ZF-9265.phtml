    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Unit tests for Zend_Http_Client appear to hang on Socket tests</p>

<p>Dynamic host: Apache 2.2.9-10 / Linux Debian Lenny
PHP: 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1</p>

<p>Tracked it down to the calls to stream_copy_to_stream. 
Replacing the stream_copy_to_stream with an equivalent fread+fwrite appears to fix it.</p>

            <p>Patch contains
 - Replaced stream_copy_to_stream with matching fread/fwrite.
 - minor code refactoring to reduce some of the duplicate code
 - adjusted some unit tests to stop errors from dumping binary blobs to the command line.</p>

            <p>The patch seems to just read everything into memory - which kind of defies the purpose of using streams, which is not to load the whole big file into memory.</p>

<p>Please also note what exactly test you are running that hangs and with which settings.
I also see you are running very old PHP - please test with newer 5.2 or 5.3.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>

<p>Are you sure that this can be reproduced by simply running the Socket tests and not with the Proxy adapter tests?</p>

<p>I was able to reproduce this only with the Proxy adapter, and that was fixed by Stas in CS-21792.</p>

<p>If you are able to reproduce this after this fix, please provide the info requested above. If not, please mark as resolved.</p>

            <p>Most likely it is due to the age of my PHP.</p>
