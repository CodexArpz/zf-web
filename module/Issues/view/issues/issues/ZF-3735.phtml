    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>After a select() in which I query only a limited number of fields, like:</p>

<p>$table-&gt;select()-&gt;from($table, array('id', 'title')) etcetera...</p>

<p>if I execute this my row object only has two column properties, like i would expect.
However, after an update via save(), _refresh() is called, which populates *all* columns.</p>

<p>The resulting behavior seems rather inconsistent:</p>

<p>$row = $table-&gt;fetchRow($select);   /* results in a row with only two column properties <em>/
$row-&gt;title = "New";                         /</em> trying to access other columns, besides 'id' will fail, of course <em>/
$row-&gt;save();                                  /</em> but after this, $row suddenly has all columns populated */</p>

<p>And yes of course, if I really want to any performance benefits from limiting the select to two fields, I shouldn't be using Zend_Db_Table_Row anyway, so this is just a dumb idea to begin with.
But the behavior just seems, well, wrong....</p>

            <p>I dont think your use case is supported by the Table-Row Gateway pattern.  The reason why _refesh() is called is so that the Row object is kept in sync with database row - which means, consequently, it needs to keep each column updated that is defined within the table.</p>

<p>I am inclined to mark this as "wont fix" / "not an issue"</p>

<p>Simon, what do you think?</p>
