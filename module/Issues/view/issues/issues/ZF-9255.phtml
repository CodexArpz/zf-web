    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Current version of Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv doesn't support to query unicode characters (i.e Japanese) in the database without prepared statements.
As upddate(), delete() and fetchAll() methods don't support "real" prepared statements (str_replaces are done in the methods) it's not possible to support unicode characters.</p>

<p>The problem lies in the _quote method of Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv, as it doesn't quote to a unicode string.
Microsoft SQL Server requires an prepended N to recognize unicode strings.
So a query with japanese characters has to look like this: 
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE myColumn = N'[japanese characters]';</p>

<p>So _quote method should also prepend the N for unicode characters. For this also the Zend_Db_Statement _stripQuoted method has to be adjusted as this only works with a single quoting character, which also has to be the same at start and end.</p>

            <p>We created this patch to fix this problem.
It prepends the required N and extends _stripQuoted to also handle this kind of quoting.</p>

<p>We hope this helps to fix that bug in one of the next releases.</p>

            <p>This patch could be OK, but what about prepared statements? I still can't get my unicode strings with db-&gt;update or db-&gt;insert methods</p>

            <p>Support for real prepared statements would be great, but is not part of this bug.</p>
