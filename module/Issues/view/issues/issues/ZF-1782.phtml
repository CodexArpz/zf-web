    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>A new option should be added which allows Zend_Translate to load a language when it's needed.</p>

<p>Now all languages have to be loaded in memory, which makes it consume much memory if you are having much translations.</p>

<p>With this option "reducememory" Zend_Translate would first load only which languages are avaiable and check if the files are properly or defect.</p>

<p>As soon as a translation occurs the expected language will be loaded.
Internally the list of known languages makes it possible to act as it is done now.</p>

<p>The loading of the language afterwards mean
*) Only one language in memory
*) Needs more time on the first translation of a language as all needed sources are loaded</p>

<p>Most applications would probably only use one or two of multiple languages so the benefit is given on a real multi-lingual application.</p>

            <p>Will not be implemented.</p>

<p>The benefit is only acceptable for applications with more than 50.000 translation.
And this applications will split their translations in multiple pieces and not load them all together.</p>

<p>Loading the translations afterwards is not precticable for all adapters.
It will maybe implemented for single adapters like SQL.</p>
