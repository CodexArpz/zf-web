    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>class Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Preprocessing_Term had a couple of @todo lines (and thrown exceptions) regarding handling of term text when it was parsed as multiple tokens, either due to a stemming or synonym analyzer, or due to space interpreted characters in the term (like underscore)</p>

<p>The same with  Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Preprocessing_Fuzzy</p>

<p>This patch adds awareness to both types of multi-tokens, and rewrites such queries (even when including wildcards) as Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Phrase</p>

<p>(instead of Query_MultiToken as before)</p>

<p>thereby handling $token-&gt;getPositionIncrement() to find out wether a token is to be handled as an alternative (0) or part of a "phrase" (&gt;0) and setting the correct position within the phrase.</p>

<p>This patch works standalone for searching, however in order to have highlighting working correctly, it needs the Temp-Index highlighting patch ( ZF-7736 ).</p>

<p>regards</p>

<p>Corvus Corax</p>

<p>PS: this extends the patches attached to ZF-7688, supposedly fixing that bug</p>

            <p>@todo</p>

<p>the test in Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Preprocessing_Term wether wildcard term alternatives have been found for all positions in the to be created Phrase query doesn't take on-purpose gaps into account and assumes there need to be tokens present for ALL positions.</p>

<p>Basically that means, the case "$token-&gt;getPositionIncrement() &gt;= 2" is not taken care of and may need additional work to give usefull results.</p>

<p>It may not be very relevant in practice, but, as they say,  never say "never" ;)</p>

<p>this issue should be much more easy to fix in Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Preprocessing_Fuzzy.</p>

<p>but I have no time doing that now, I am off for a holiday trip for the next two weeks.</p>

            <p>Bug has been closed by default in "Bulk change". However patch is already attached to bug, what has been missing is a maintainer</p>

            <p>I tried to apply the patch, but it failed, so I applied it manually. However it causes the unit tests to fail.</p>

<p>Are you able to fix the patch?</p>
