    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>This will allow for easily setting row classes based on a common naming convention, eg:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
abstract class My_Db_Table_Abstract extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
{
    protected function _setup()
    {
        parent::_setup();
        $this-&gt;_setupRowClass();
    }
    
    protected function _setupRowClass()
    {
        if (class_exists($class = get_class($this) . '_Row')) {
            $this-&gt;_rowClass = $class;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>But doesn't this depend on the rowClass being available at the time of instantiation? Or are you envisaging a 'require_once' within your table definition to have this class definition pre-loaded?</p>

<p>I'd recommend something more reliable... like, say, a Zend_Db_Table_Plugin to set this during an init() event ;)</p>

            <p>Well yes, it would rely on the rowClass being available during instantiation, but then in most cases the auto loader would include it when the class_exists is run. But then, this might not necessarily have to rely on the class being loaded. I didn't see the implementation of _setupRowClass above as the default, it's simply a method you can override if you wish to set the row class in a consistent manner across all tables, rather than setting the _rowClass property manually in every table class. In exactly the same way we already have _setupTableName.</p>

<p>This is of course something that could be done with a table plugin (once that's ready :) ), as the whole purpose of the plugin proposal is to remove the need to extend Zend_Db_Table_Abstract with another abstract class implementing custom logic, and you could say exactly the same about _setupTableName.</p>

            <p>This issue has gone unaddressed for too long. I'm reassigning this to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.</p>

            <p>Not sure if this is the solution we want, but the feature is linked (in a round about way) to another feature request</p>

            <p>I think between the concrete instantiation coming in 1.9 and the Zend_Application autoloader from 1.8, I think we having this feature in place.</p>
