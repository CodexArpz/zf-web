    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The way the application bootstrapper handles resources seems way inconsistent and badly documented.
The front controller has to be defined (in application.ini) as resource.frontController (big C) but e.g. a custom error handler resource can be defined as "errorhandler".
As the class shipped by the framework is called "Frontcontroller" it should be addressed as "resource.frontcontroller" in the application.ini</p>

<p>All this caseing ran me into big trouble when switching a working test-app from a windows box (case-insensitive) to a linux box (case-sensitive) as the system didn't find the files but also switched the internal order of the plugins to load.</p>

<p>Tested against the SVN checkout rev 18431, checked out today.</p>

<p>Sorry if the bug description lacks of some info, I'm a native German speaker and thus can't always express me perfectly.
Feel free to mail me if you need code samples or other informations.</p>

            <p>This is really annoying as frontController resource cannot be overwritten!</p>

<p>guilty code line is here:
ZFv1.11.11: Zend_Application_Bootstrap_BootstrapAbstract::_loadPluginResource():
        $className = $this-&gt;getPluginLoader()-&gt;load(strtolower($resource), false);</p>

<p>There should be no call to strtolower.
Because of this call, all plugin resources must be named with a capital letter at first and only lower case letters after that.
=&gt; I could not manage to load my plugin resource named 'MailBox' because of that; it cost me 1h of debugging to find the guilty line and I am forced to name my resource plugin "Mailbox".
It also highlight the fact that FrontController resource cannot be easily overloaded because of this call to strtolower.</p>

            <p>Changing this at this time is non-trivial, non-backwards compatible, and introduces performance overhead, unfortunately -- and this is in fact a major reason behind changes to plugin loading for 2.0.</p>

            <p>Marking as won't fix, as we've already identified the changes needed, and do not feel we can apply them in the 1.X series. Since Zend_Application and the application resources are not used in 2.0, there will be no fix for the next major version.</p>
