    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>hi 
i would like to create a custom element where this element would  have</p>

<p>1 file element
1 text element (for a caption for the file)</p>

<p>however the view helper it hard coded into the Zend_Form_Element_File class</p>

<p>why a want to create a combo element like this is because i got 10 files to upload on a page and if I have to use 2 elements instead of 1 combo element then there will be a lot more code to to create a work around or 2to3 times more calling to the data base which mean more server load</p>

<p>there is a related bug already mentioned <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8136">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8136</a> but it seem is not an issue BUT it is because its the same issue i currently have.</p>

<p>Also this is the only element that does not have a value if there was just text to state a file name that already uploaded when form was populated that would make the user experience so much better</p>

            <p>Reclassifying as minor new feature.  The use case you describe is not in the scope of the current Zend_Form_Element_File / Zend_View_Helper_FormFile pair.  What you will need to do is extend the existing elements to create a "combo element" class.  An example of how this is done can be seen here (it's a three-field date element, but the principle is the same)
