    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When adding a validator to a form, it seems impossible to use the opposite of a validator.</p>

<p>Use Case: Having a form validator that does check if some value does not occur in an array. Want to use the 'not' InArray validator. Zend_Form will call isValid() and we can't use the opposite value of the boolean.</p>

            <p>This is not possible with a generic solution.</p>

<p>The problem is, that when something is "valid" it does not mean that it can simply be made "not valid". See Regex for example: Just because a regex returns true, it is not said that it also works the other way.</p>

<p>Or take an CreditCard number. The check if a credit card is valid uses multiple validations. They are run part by part and only the sum of all checks gives the result.</p>

<p>On the other side, what should be returned when a validation is true (false). This would negotate the complete message logic.</p>

<p>I see such a behaviour problematic.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

<p>Why not just invert the most final resulting validation. It's the same as inverting the result of isValid(). It might be possible to implement this in Zend_From instead of in the validators, maybe that makes more sense. It makes sense (though it would be quite uncommon) to check if an given number is 'not' a creditcard number. I don't see a validator chain messing that up.</p>

<p>I can see the message logic going haywire with this though: messages tell something over the validity of input, while they would now need to tell something about the invalidity of the input. I indeed don't see a solution for this straightaway.</p>

            <p>Closing as won't fix</p>

<p>If someone is in need of an reversed validator he should extend the validator, reverse the output and change the messages according to his needs.</p>
