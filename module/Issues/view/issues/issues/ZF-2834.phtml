    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, Zend_Form implements a pre-filter, allowing the ability to normalize or filter data prior to validation to make validations easier and/or more semantically correct.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, it may be useful to have a postfilter as well. For instance, if you were to attach a form to a model as both a validator and a mechanism for rendering the model as a form, you might wish to have a postfilter available for use when injecting the data into the model's storage mechanism (for instance, encoding data as base64 for use with xml-rpc, or passing through a database's quoting mechanisms prior to injection, etc).</p>

<p>I propose such a postfiltering mechanism work in conjunction with validation; it would only be applied <em>after</em> the data has passed validation. Additionally, a mechanism should be in place to filter the data on-demand, and this should be separate from getValue().</p>

            <p>This feature is a nice enhancement.</p>

<p>Currently seems to be more complicated to automated such things for injecting the data into model.</p>

            <p>Postponing the issue until 2.0. I'd like to create the ability to create validation/filter/decorator chains as separate objects that you then attach to Zend_Form/Zend_Form_Element. This will make adding postfilters easier.</p>
