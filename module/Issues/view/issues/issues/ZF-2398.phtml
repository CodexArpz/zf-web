    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The Zend_View_Helper_HeadLink component uses shorthand tag closing notation on all link elements, regardless of the DOCTYPE provided to the Zend_View_Helper_Doctype component.  I.e., it always produces elements like the following:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of the following:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre>

<p>The current behavior is fine for documents written as XHTML, but not necessarily for HTML without the X; running such a document through the W3 validator (as, say, HTML 4.01 Strict) produces warnings and errors.</p>

<p>This is a fairly trivial problem (since most browsers have no problem handling this kind of shorthand even in older flavors of HTML), but I think it would also be fairly trivial to fix (in fact, there's a good, simple precedent in lines 374-380 of the HeadScript helper), and doing so would make the framework's output more compliant with W3 standards (if only a little).</p>

            <p>This seems to be the source of a few inconsistencies</p>

<p>Neither Zend_View_Helper_HeadMeta or Zend_View_Helper_HeadStyle make any allowances for different doctypes either, however both default to using non-XHTML mark-up.</p>

<p>Other Zend_View_Helper_* seem to default to XHTML, as in this case, although I've only checked a few.</p>

<p>As we have a doctype check with isXhtml() it seems sensible to use it across the board and to have a consistent default.  At the moment tag soup is inevitable due to the existing defaults and the fact that only one Helper seems to allow changes.</p>
