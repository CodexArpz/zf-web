    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I have a suggestion for the Zend_Db component of the Zend Framework. I was wondering if it would be possible to include a check in the Db component to check to see if the PDO extensions are installed on a system.</p>

<p>I am working on a database application and was trying to get information to the database. After trying everything in the manual, I checked my installation and found out the I did not have the PDO extensions installed.</p>

<p>If a check for PDO was in place and threw an exception, I would have cut down on my debugging.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a suggestion. Thank you for you time and for a great framework.</p>

<p>Regards, Troy L. Marker</p>

            <p>This patch adds a check to make sure the PDO driver is installed. If not it throws a Zend_DB_Adapter_Exception</p>

            <p>Patch lead to identification of another bug (see [ZF-164]) and related issues with checks/tests at run-time.</p>

<p>Also see the fw-general discussion regarding Zend_Environment,
and where to put checks and tests that do not need to be executed
on instantiation / every page view.</p>
