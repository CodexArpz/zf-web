    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I installed the version 1.5.0 on a localhost on my computer and I've developed an application. All was working on a local computer. But when I putted the version on line, I had a php error message.</p>

<p>It seems that some server are case sensitive and in the 1.5.0 version some classes are called with "require_once", like this:
bq. require_once 'Zend/mail/.../...';
instead of
bq. require_once 'Zend/Mail/.../...';</p>

<p>I only checked it in the Mail module. I don't know what about the other require_once calls in the other modules...</p>

<p>Hope it's gona be helpfull ;)</p>

            <p>Do you know which files you found 'require_once 'Zend/mail/.../...';'? With a quick grep I couldn't find /mail/ anywhere, but in the docs. Also you should upgrade to the latest version.</p>

            <p>I corrected the mistake with a grep to, but I haven't any record of the olds files... sorry.
All the corrupted lines where in the Mail.php file and in the Mail folder. That's all I can tell you.
Maybe I had an old version. I'll check in the new one.
thx!</p>
