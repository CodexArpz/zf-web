    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>There are a handful of Zend_Gdata classes which do not lazy-load exceptions before throwing them. These should be corrected and stricken from the list of offending classes at:</p>

            <p>Currently waiting on clarification of policy for Exception subclasses, since these also show up on the list of classes to be fixed.</p>

            <p>Okay, as I expected, Exception subclasses are exempt. That leaves about 5 classes that need to be fixed.</p>

            <p>Ryan,
I think those were the exceptions that needed to be updated to resolve ZF-1752. I've had a patch sitting around to do that for a while (it's a simple change), but I've been hesitant to commit it without updating the unit tests.</p>

            <p>Hi Trevor,</p>

<p>Yep-- sorry, didn't see that bug.  This was causing exceptions when running the sample app.  While unit tests would be nice, my priority in this case was making the sample app work  :)  I resolved the issue, but left it assigned to you so you can attach unit tests if/when you get a chance.  If you'd prefer to re-open it in the meantime, that'd be fine too.</p>

<p>We should have a status of 'resolved in trunk, but still needs unit test'</p>

<p>Cheers,
-Ryan</p>
