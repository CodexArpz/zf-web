    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The documentation at <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.navigation.containers.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a> contains an example of setting up a Zend_Navigation object. The first 'page' in the array looks like:</p>

<p>array(
        'label' =&gt; 'Page 1',
        'id' =&gt; 'home-link'
),</p>

<p>Use of this 'page' causes an exception:</p>

<p>Zend_Navigation_Exception: Invalid argument: Unable to determine class to instantiate in /path/to/ZendFramework-1.8.4PL1/library/Zend/Navigation/Page.php on line 222</p>

<p>This makes learning and experimentation with Zend_Navigation highly frustrating, since it is not clear that the specification/configuration of the page is the problem. The simplest thing might be to update the documentation to omit the page specification that causes the failure, but perhaps application of sane defaults when attributes of a page specification are absent would be better.</p>

            <p>This is not a bug. It's a test to see if people actually read the documentation.</p>

            <p>It's a simple documentation issue.</p>

<p>The factory cannot determine which page type to create unless it's given a param that's distinct for a particular page type (be it any of uri, action, controller, module, or route). This <em>is</em> the sane default behaviour.</p>

<p>However, others have also complained about the factory not being able to tell specifically where the error is. I'm considering adding something to identify pages with in the error message, typically the page's label if it is defined. The ideal approach would be to have a schema for the configuration file, so the class loading the config file could tell where in the <em>file</em> the error is. This is waay down the line, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Fair enough, a documentation fix suits me fine. It was not at all obvious what was supposed to happen with that page specification, and had it worked, I'd be more concerned about undocumented magic producing a link to the home page.</p>

<p>Identifying the file location could be helpful, assuming the specifcation was coming from configuration. However, my requirements demand that I compose navigation elements from a variety of resources, some of which are computed. Perhaps an interim solution would be to var_dump (or something comparable) the specification that caused the exception; in many cases, that would identify errant specification, or at least narrow down the list of contenders.</p>

<p>Thanks for attending to this so quickly.</p>
