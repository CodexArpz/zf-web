    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Many users expect to see {{isDate()}} or {{checkDate()}} as methods of Zend_Date.  For reasons not immediately obvious, {{isDate()}} exists in Zend_Locale_Format, but has more and different functionality and features than common to typical "isDate" functions.  There is a real need for an extremely simple "isDate"/"checkDate" function in Zend_Date.</p>

<p>Since Zend_Date supports year values far beyond many other PHP functions, we may not be able to use <a href="http://www.php.net/checkdate">http://www.php.net/checkdate</a> (I have not tested with extreme values).</p>

<p>In order to answer the question "isDate($dateString)", we must decide what kinds of input are accepted for $dateString.  Since Zend_Date objects can not be constructed from invalid dates, allowing instances of Zend_Date as input does not make sense.  Thus, functions supporting "isDate" / "checkDate" must be static methods.</p>

<p>The $dateString must be normalized.  Date parts must be extracted from the normalized string.  Then the parts must be checked for completeness and validity.  For example:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$parts = Zend_Date::getDateParts($date, $format = null, $locale = null);

echo Zend_Date::checkDateParts($parts) ? 'date is valid' : 'date is not valid';

// checkDate() could combine the two steps above:
echo Zend_Date::checkDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null) ? 'date is valid' : 'date is not valid';
</code></pre>

            <p>So, I am still hoping for community feedback about "intuitive" functionality for:</p>

<p>Zend_Date::isDate()
Zend_Locale_Format::isDate()
Zend_Date::checkDateParts()
Zend_Date::checkDate()
etc.</p>

<p>For example, what would you expect the functions above to do, without reading any API docs?</p>

<p>Things to consider include how to check date strings for calendar validity (i.e. April 41st is not a valid date in any year), and how to check if a given date string matches a given date format.</p>

            <p>For example, the following code returns "true":</p>

            <p>As mentioned in another issue:</p>

<p>Zend_Locale_Format parses inputs and can only normalize and localize.
So a isDate function within Zend_Locale_Format only returns if the given localized string contains all wished date parts...</p>

<p>But as this class has not to know what a date is and how it works, it would never give false on dates which are no strict dates as 30. February for example.</p>

<p>Zend_Date is the only class which has the possibility and the logic background to verify the content of dates.</p>

<p>Related to the other things mentioned here I will give feedback as soon as I have time to think of the related API changes... latest end of this week.</p>

            <p>There is a consistency issue, if Zend_Date::isDate() checks the validity of a date, but Zend_Locale_Format::isDate() checks if the input matches a format string.</p>

<p>Perhaps Zend_Locale_Format::isDate()  =&gt; Zend_Locale_Format::dateMatchesFormat() ?</p>

            <p>Zend_Locale_Format::containsDate ;-) 
instead of dateMatchesFormat.</p>

<p>Related to function names:</p>

<p>Zend_Date::isDate -&gt; would check if the string contains a complete date...</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
Zend_Date::isDate('20.April'); -&gt; FALSE because year is missing
Zend_Date::isDate('20.April.2007'); -&gt; TRUE
Zend_Date::isDate('30.02.2007'); -&gt; TRUE because it does not validate the input
Zend_Date::isDate('20.April.2007 10:20:30'); -&gt; TRUE... time is additionally given
</code></pre>

<p>Zend_Date::checkDate -&gt; would validate the string</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
Zend_Date::checkDate('20.April.2007') -&gt; TRUE
Zend_Date::checkDate('30.02.2007') -&gt; FALSE because this date does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>More functions are not needed or only internal and private</p>

            <p>-1 for "containsDate".</p>

<p>How about "checkFormat()" or "isDateFormat()" for checking if a date string matches a date format?
I think this function should be capable of checking whether the date string matches any basic self-defined date format, regardless of whether or not the date string contains a year or seconds (for example)  <em>OR</em> we could reduce our goal/functionality and only check whether a date matches the default format for the user-specified locale.  Usually, I would want to combine date format validation with normalization and creation of a Zend_Date object, where the result is "false" if the input date string failed to match the selected date format <em>or</em> failed to match a valid calendar date <em>or</em> failed to match a valid clock time.
```
$date = Zend_Date::getValidDate('25:59:59', 'H:m:s'</p>

<p>How about "isDate()" for determining if a date string is a valid date - i.e. same as checkdate()?</p>

<p>In general, the ZF gives preference to using "is<em>()" for methods returning true or false, but it is difficult to find a good "is</em>()" name for checking the format of a data string.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that we are speaking here of two different classes...</p>

<p>Related to Zend_Locale_Format:</p>

<p>The function should not be named checkFormat because we have 2 formats... date and number... maybe in future even more (scientific, percentage...). Then the user would not know which localized format would be checked...</p>

<p>"checkDateFormat()" would be much better.</p>

<p>isDateFormat() would in my eyes mean, if the given format is a date format... this is not what we want to check ;-)
The function has to check if all given date and or time parts from the format are present in the given string and if the position is correct... it should also be possible for the user to give a self defined format as it is already supported.
But Zend_Locale_Format would only return the found and corrected date parts which are of course normalized... this is the general behaviour of this class... to normalize input. Creation of Zend_Date objects is part of Zend_Date... Zend_Locale_Format is only the normalization/localization part of Zend_Locale.</p>

<p>Related to Zend_Date:
Zend_Date itself will call Zend_Locale_Format internally to receive the normalized values from the given date as it is done already.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be better to have Zend_Date::isDate() and Zend_Date::isValidDate() ?
Or do we really want to eliminate the possibility of checking non-conform dates/times like "30.Feb.1400" ?</p>

<p>getValidDate() is useless because you would probably use
$date = new Zend_Date('23:59:59', 'HH:mm:ss');
instead for creating a date.</p>

            <p>{quote}Wouldn't it be better to have Zend_Date::isDate() and Zend_Date::isValidDate() ?{quote}</p>

<p>I believe many users would find this very confusing, because they sound like they do the same thing.</p>

<p>I think checkDateFormat() is an acceptable name for a method that compares date strings against date format strings.</p>

<p>Regarding getValidDate(), yes, what you said was exactly the message I was trying to say.  However, there is one key difference.  When trying to determine if a given date string is valid, often automatic date correction/fixing is not wanted.</p>

            <p>Zend_Locale_Format:</p>

<p>Ok... Agreed...
"isDate()" will be changed to "checkDateFormat()"
"isTime()" will be integrated into "checkDateFormat()"</p>

<p>checkDateFormat gives true if all given date parts can be parsed / found... otherwise false will be returned.</p>

<p>Zend_Date:</p>

<p>Then let's degrade...
Zend_Date::isDate() will only check on valid dates.
Invalid dates can be checked with Zend_Locale_Format.</p>

            <p>Yes, sounds good.</p>

<p>I do not see a reason to provide checkDateFormat() within Zend_Date, and Zend_Date::isDate() can perform date validation just like PHP's checkdate().</p>
