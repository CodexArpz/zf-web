            <p>Why is this component assigned to Wil ???
What is the dev-branch 1.7 ?</p>

<p>I can't find it in SVN... how should I solve this when no branch is available ?</p>

            <p>Hmmm. Not sure why it was assigned to me, but it should definitely be assigned to you, Thomas. I verified that you're the component lead in JIRA and the Zend_Locale component is configured to assign automatically to component lead.
In any case, we'll be doing a 1.7 preview release on 9/13. We won't be branching for this, since it's not feature-complete and it would be a pain to merge all the work that will eventually go in to 1.7 RC's. Just check in the fix to trunk. I'll create a release planning page for contributors on the wiki soon, so hopefully you'll be more synced up with our plans.</p>

            <p>Thanks for clearification, Wil.
So all this issues are related to trunk.</p>

<p>Alex:
I understand this issue and know where it's related.
Interesting that it's not on windows.</p>

<p>Anyhow... what makes me wonder is that you don't get a notice or something from PHP, because a statically declared method is called from an instance.
Shouldn't phpunit also return such errors ???</p>

Alex, can you please verify this ?</p>

<li><p>If I'm correct PHP allows to call static methods as instance methods, but not vice versa. But it may depend on a version</p></li>
