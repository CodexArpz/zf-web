    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The assemble() method in Zend_Rest_Route can not create a url for the "new" action. Instead, it provides a link to the index action ("/products" instead of "/products/new"). This is not the same as the match() method which makes allowances for the "index" and "new" actions.</p>

<p>This may also be the root issue behind ZF-7753. Included patch is against trunk.</p>

<p>The fix is small, but it may create a (very small) BC-break/bug if the $params['index'] is also set as this also tries to generate a url for the index action. That said, the $params['index'] behavior may be a bug that should instead become $params['action] == 'index'. Please let me know if I should file this under another ticket.</p>

            <p><em>&gt;&gt; BC-break/bug if the $params['index'] is also set as this also tries to generate a url for the index action.</em></p>

<p>There is no problem here because 'index' is checked for as a key (see example):</p>

<p>$this-&gt;url(array('id' =&gt; 1, 'key' =&gt; 'value', 'action' =&gt; 'edit', 'index' =&gt; true));</p>

<p>The TRUE constant is only needed so that some positive (evaluates to true) value is given. The Zend_Rest_Route#assemble method
will find 'index' to be set and it's value evaluates to true (so 1 or '1' or true would work equally well as it doesn't check for === TRUE). The 'index' value is this removed from the parameters array and the remaining parameters (id, key) are added to the resulting URL string.</p>

<p>'action' has already been removed from the parameters array by this point so it will not accidentally be added to the string.</p>

<p>Having 'index' =&gt; true also negates having 'action' =&gt; 'edit' or 'action' =&gt; 'new'. In other words, if 'index' =&gt; true, then 'action' is ignored.</p>

            <p>The BC-break only occured (as I recall) with the now removed patches. Your newer patch fixes a few more things and does not suffer from the same problem. All good. :)</p>

<p>However, my main question about the index key was exactly what you point out. Why does it search for "index" =&gt; true, and not "action" =&gt; "index" like all other routes do? If I pass in array("action" =&gt; "edit", "index" =&gt; true), I expect it not to ignore action but instead treat index as a named parameter.</p>

<p>I see what you mean. Good point.
So, if you did this:</p>

<p>$this-&gt;url(array('id' =&gt; 1, 'action' =&gt; 'index', 'another' =&gt; 'parameter'));</p>

<p>would you want it to generate this:</p>

<p>/index/1/another/parameter</p>

<p>or this:</p>

<p>/index/id/1/another/parameter</p>

<p>or something completely different?</p>

            <p>Personally I would prefer the former. ID is a special param in Zend_Rest_Route, it makes sense for it to remain invisible.</p>
