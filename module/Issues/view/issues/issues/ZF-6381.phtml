    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Add an optional second parameter to Zend_Registry::get()</p>

<p>In the case of if (!$instance-&gt;offsetExists($index)) instead of always throwing an exception, look to see if the second param is not null and return that value.  If it's null, then go ahead and throw the exception.</p>

<p>This greatly improves the usability of this method as I won't have to always put it in a try/catch block when there is an acceptable default.</p>

            <p>I see a small problem here:
How would you differentiate between "my default value is {{NULL}}" and "please throw an exception if key is not found"?
Most likely that would require a third argument to {{Zend_Registry::get()}} - such as {{$throwOnNotFound}} or something like that.</p>

            <p>Option 1) (the assumed option requested by this issue) The user just doesn't get to use NULL, that's the price you pay for wanting a throw exception feature.<br />
This is very easily worked around by passing a blank string or a 0 and using that response.</p>

<p>Option 2) Don't have the default be NULL, have it be something unusual like '<strong>throw_exception</strong>'
Then you can compare to that fixed string and know if an exception should be thrown.</p>

<p>Option 3) Don't define a second parameter and use func_get_arg(1)
This president has already been set with the isValid() method in Zend_Validate_Abstract/Zend_Validate_Interface but is difficult to document.</p>
