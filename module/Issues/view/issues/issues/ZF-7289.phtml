    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I came across valid usecases some time ago which gave me 2 rows in a table with both the same username. Zend_Auth didn't like this, and gave me some ambiguity error. Imho Zend_Auth makes an assumption here that should be left up to the developer. Therefore I propose to add a flag by which the developer(s) can either disable or enable this check.</p>

            <p>Create a sample database.
Insert two user accounts with the same username, but different passwords.
Attempt to log in as one of them. 
Await Error: "More than one record matches the supplied identity."</p>

<p>Users of our system do not interact with each other, there's no reason to force username uniqueness. Yes, we are catching duplicate passwords :).</p>

            <p>In my opinion this isn't something what Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable should implement.</p>

<p>One question:
What message do you show if on user would like to change it's password to the same as one of the other users with the same name?
-&gt;  Sorry, your given password is already defined by an other user. !??!?!?!?!?</p>

<p>I think you have do write our own adapter (out of zf) if this functionality is a must have for you.</p>

            <p>that's not the point, the point is that zend_auth shouldn't contrain me, at least not unoptionally (as of now, that is English).</p>

            <p>implemented this issue into the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable.</p>

<p>usage:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$authAdapter-&gt;setAmbiguityIdentity(true);
</code></pre>

<p>can also be used fluently.</p>

            <p>I think that is best apply in Minor release.
Too can be mentioned this feature in the manual.</p>
