    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently when an exception with the code, e.g. {{123}} is thrown, it's converted to the {{Receiver}} fault code, since SOAP allows only a set of base faults: (Receiver, Sender, Server, MustUnderstand, VersionMismatch, DataEncodingUnknown).</p>

<p>However, SOAP also supports extending those base faults with your own codes. By using the {{.}} (dot) as a separator.</p>

<p>It would be nice if the server can support this standard notation.</p>

<p>Note: The challenge, which I think should be tackled in a separate issue once this is done, is to how to convert exception codes (Integers) to an extended fault. One way which we currently use is to throw {{My_Soap_Fault}} instead of SoapFault, and {{My_Soap_Fault}} is has a set of rules which it uses to convert an exception code, e.g. {{123}} to {{Sender.123}}, but {{789}} to {{Receiver.789}}.</p>
