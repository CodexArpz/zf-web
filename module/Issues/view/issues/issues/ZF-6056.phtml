    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>At least the following Zend_AMF issues are not present in the 1.7.7 release, even though they were marked as fixed quite long ago:</p>

<p>ZF-5078 Zend_Amf does not properly serialize Zend_Amf_Value_ByteArray instances (marked as fixed in 1.7.2)
ZF-5079 Zend_Amf doesn't encode SimpleXMLElement or DOMDocument as flash XML type (marked as fixed, no version specified)
ZF-5346 AMF3 Messages with Object as first param fails with badVersion
ZF-5381 Create session management of subsequent AMF calls. (marked as fixed in 1.7.5)
ZF-5388 Zend_Amf_Server handles arguments wrong</p>

<p>These are the only ones I checked specifically for since they are bugs I've been encountering.  It'd be great to get these merged in properly.</p>

<p>Issue "ZF-5079 Zend_Amf doesn't encode SimpleXMLElement or DOMDocument as flash XML type" also doesn't seem to have been incorporated into the trunk (at least not with the patch I submitted).  Fisheye doesn't report any commits being made for that issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great work on this project.  I hope to see these issues resolved in the next release.</p>

            <p>I just was informed yesterday that it is my job to move the code into the release. This was magically done for me for awhile. Now I know.</p>

            <p>No prob then, just wanted to make sure you were aware of it.  Again, thanks for the great work, and the quick response.</p>

            <p>These changes have been added into the 1.7 release branch and will be a part of the next mini release. I have added features and changed to much code. So it should make everyones life easier with these out of trunk!</p>
