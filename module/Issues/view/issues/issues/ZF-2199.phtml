    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Currently, after performing a query in Flickr, one typically iterates over the results using:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$results = $flickr-&gt;tagSearch($tagQuery, $options);
foreach ($results as $result) {
  echo $result-&gt;id;
  echo $result-&gt;Thumbnail-&gt;uri;
  //etc
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each result is of type Zend_Service_Flickr_Result. In the constructor of this class, additional image details are acquired by performing an additional query, and thus connecting to the Flickr servers:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
foreach ($this-&gt;_flickr-&gt;getImageDetails($this-&gt;id) as $k =&gt; $v) {
  $this-&gt;$k = $v;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the result-set, as mentioned before, gets large, the amount of queries to the Flickr service also increase, decreasing overall performance. For example:</p>

<p>20 images are fetched. Using the basic search command, this requires only one query. But when processing the results, another 20 queries for image details are fired to the Flickr-servers. As a work-around in my web-application, I first send over the image-details to the browser (id, text, etc) and I send over some javascript which performs a new Ajax-call. This Ajax-call results in fetching the details of an image and filling in the src-attribute. of the already loaded skeleton of the image. Now the search takes me only a few miliseconds, after which the user receives a response from the webserver (the image skeletons), and THEN the images start to popup as a result of the Ajax-calls. A disadvantage of this solution is the increased server-load, caused by the various incoming ajax-requests for image details. Nevertheless it significantly decreases the time it takes to send back some result to the user</p>

<p>In summary: I would like to see the option to NOT fetch the imageDetails when processing the results, increasing initial performance and overall user-experience.</p>

            <p>Hi,
I'm quite new to ZF and this is my first comment, so I may be posting to a wrong place, please correct me if I'm wrong. I faced this problem in one of my projects, here is the proposed solution:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
  public function __get($name)
  {
    // parameters that are present in initial search result
    if(in_array($name,array('id','owner','secret','server','title','ispublic','isfriend','isfamily')))
    {
      return $this-&gt;{$name};
    }
    else
    {
      foreach ($this-&gt;_flickr-&gt;getImageDetails($this-&gt;id) as $k =&gt; $v) {
        $this-&gt;$k = $v;
      }
    }
    return $this-&gt;{$name};
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This method is to be added to Zend_Service_Flickr_Result and, obviously, we can remove this foreach loop in constructor.</p>

<p>I have also implemented flickr search by latitude/longitude and bounding box, is it possible to create a ticket and add the code there?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
