    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When using Zend_Http_Client to POST data to a specified URL, the POST data is not populated correctly. Looking at the code, it should work according to my (limited) knowledge of HTTP. But it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>I've tested this with a setup of PHP 5.1.4 with the following configure:</p>

<p>'./configure' '--with-xml' '--with-xslt' '--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs' '--with-curl' '--with-mysql=/storage/mysql' '--enable-mbstring' '--enable-sockets' '--enable-pdo' '--with-pdo-mysql=/storage/mysql'</p>

<p>on Apache/2.0.55 (Unix)</p>

<p>Test scripts with which I can reproduce this are attached as files. Server script (server.php) always gives an empty array when doing print_r($_POST).</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Additional info:</p>

<p>The request itself is being received by the receiving script. The headers arrive as they should. I added an extra header, and this is being displayed by the server.php script. The Content-length header contains the right amount for the test data being sent. Echo-ing the data inside Zend_Http_Client also displays that the data is correct when it is being sent.</p>

<p>For some reason though, the actual body of the POST message is not being recognized and parsed as $_POST data.</p>

<p>On a hunch, I just tried to see what are the contents of $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA and this one is actually being filled. If this is a feature, then we need to document it I think. If this is a bug, we should fix it ;)</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>I didn't test, but I'd bet this is because you do not set a 'Content-type' header in the request.
Please try to set an extra header: 'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and see what happens.</p>

<p>In the new HTTP client (incubator) this is handeled automatically. If this is the case, I see no point in fixing the old client.</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Wonderful, that indeed solves the issue. My knowledge of HTTP is clearly not good enough ;)</p>
