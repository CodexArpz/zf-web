        <p>From the beloved IRC:

 Why does Zend_Date tell me that's not right acc. to rfc 2822?
 Freeaqingme TZ names are marked as obselete in the RFC, and the +XX is preferred perhaps
 so might be expecting +0000 instead
 still, 90%of all webservers give the obs-zone
&lt;|thomas_&gt; Yes... RFC 2822 forces to have +/-0000 Timezone
 no
 hey, the RFC still says that it should accept obselete parts if its consistent
 zone            =       (( "+" / "-" ) 4DIGIT) / obs-zone
 that's what it says
 |thomas_ obselete is still supposed to be accepted according to the RFC
 as long as its not mixed.
 (2 digit years while obselete, still accepted 4 also)
&lt;|thomas_&gt; But thats 822
 so that datetime should be valid.
 |thomas_, the obselete 822 standard is incorporated in 2822, and should still be regarded valid
 |thomas_, do you want me to patch it?
&lt;|thomas_&gt; That seems not to be the only problem... the spec I had and integrated seems to be outdated or partitially false. Please add an issue. There are also other differences I have to check according to the ABN[F] I just read{quote}</p>
