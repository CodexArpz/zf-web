    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I posted about the same issue to the forums yesterday:</p>

<p>I ran into a strange problem using Zend Search Lucene. It seems to me that the function Zend_Search_Lucene::find
 has a memory leak.  When running several queries in a row it might result in the program running out of memory in the
  worst case scenario, which is my case and lead me to notice this problem.</p>

<p>Here is a simple piece of code to illustrate the problem and to replicate my findings:</p>

<p>for($i=0;$i&lt;100;$i++){
$index = new Zend_Search_Lucene($pathToIndex);
$index-&gt;find("gabba gabba hey!");
print memory_get_usage()."\n";
}</p>

<p>I far as I understand memory-consumption should remain relatively constant but now it increases steadily throughout  the iterations.
I even tried explicitly unsetting the $index with unset($index) but it didn't help.
Is it a bug in Zend Search Lucene or am I missing something? Has anybody ran into something similar yet?</p>

<p>I have now tested Zend Framework versions 1.5.1, 1.5.3 and 1.6.0 RC 1 as well and the same problem persists in both of them.</p>

<p>I am using PHP 5.2.5 in linux.</p>

            <p>Is this maybe an issue of circular references that PHP cannot resolve in versions &lt; 5.3?</p>

            <p>Is this issue resolved ? Actually I am facing same issue, for every find operation 100MB space is allocating but the same memory is not de-allocating after request processing...</p>

<p>Please let me know the solution if any body knows..</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
