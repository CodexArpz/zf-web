    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Having been working with the framework for some time now, I find that most of the current methods of Zend_Filter_Input aren't of any real use to me. Since they use regular expression functions which exclude white space, they aren't useful for most cases unless I know specifically that the Input will not include white space, or that white space is unimportant for that input (both statement are false for most input I have worked with).
In addition, I would like a built in method that uses htmlspcecialchars() and htmlentites() on the input (right now I'm extending the Zend_Filter_Input class with those methods).</p>

            <p>I'm unsure exactly what is meant here by the whitespace/regular expression problem. If related problems remain, please create additional JIRA issues that illustrate how the problems may be reproduced and that indicate the release version, nightly build date, or SVN revision. Also useful are suggestions on how the problems may be circumvented altogether (workaround) or solved outright (e.g., with a patch).</p>

<p>{{Zend_Filter_HtmlEntities}} is currently available for performing htmlentities() on the input. If you should need any additional filters, please create a JIRA issue for each filter so that each may be considered for development and framework inclusion based on its own merit.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it should be easy enough to create such filter classes by implementing {{Zend_Filter_Interface}} in userland.</p>

<p>For the above reasons, this issue is resolved as "incomplete." In the event that problems remain, please create new JIRA issues that separately describe the problems mentioned here. This facilitates independent discussion and resolution of the separate issues.</p>

<p>Thank you for the report!</p>

            <p>{{Zend_Filter_Input}} was deprecated with 0.8.0. Changing component to {{Zend_Filter}}.</p>
