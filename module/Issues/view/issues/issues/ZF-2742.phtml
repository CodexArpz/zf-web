    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Example:</p>

<p>I have two view helper paths:</p>

<p>app/views/helpers (empty string prefix)
Zfe/View/Helpers (Zfe_View_Helper)</p>

<p>I have a view helper class defined as Zfe_View_Helper_DateTime in Zfe/View/Helper/DateTime.php</p>

<p>Since DateTime is already defined (internally by PHP), Zend_View_Abstract::_loadClass() returns 'DateTime', even though app/view/helpers does not contain a DateTime helper. This problem can be reproduced for any class that is defined prior to Zend_View_Abstract::_loadClass() being called.</p>

            <p>I've added a test for this in r8445.</p>

<p>But I cannot duplicate your issue.. can you produce a test to demonstrate the issue?</p>

            <p>Change the line where the helper path is set in the test to the following:</p>

<p>$view-&gt;addHelperPath(dirname(<strong>FILE</strong>) . '/View/_stubs/HelperDir2', 'Zend_View_Helper');

            <p>Jordan,</p>

<p>I added matthew to this issue to have a look.  It seems to me that having helpers without prefixes is not something i would consider "Best Practices".  I would ask Matthew to comment on that.</p>

<p>On another note, wouldnt the code:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

class Datetime
{
    /* .... */
}

</code></pre>

<p>Throw a fatal error about not being able to redeclare a class?</p>

            <p>I'm not defining DateTime as a class. I'm defining Zfe_View_Helper_DateTime, but since '' is a defined prefix for another helper path, it's finding a match for 'DateTime' there first, and ignoring my Zfe_View_Helper_DateTime.</p>

            <p>I think ultimately, the use case you talk about: "the ability to use helpers without a prefix" is something that will continually get you in trouble since its hard to know what base classes will be included in php, and by other applications and/or code.  I think the best thing to do is always use helper prefixes.</p>

<p>After discussing with Matthew, I think that perhaps we should check to make sure a non-empty helper prefix is passed with all helper (and basePath) calls.</p>

            <p>I have a related issue (should I file it as a new bug?):</p>

<p>Helpers without a prefix do not work properly at all.</p>

<p>Assume a Helper called FunkyHelper in a file FunkyHelper.php with the "helper method" 
public function funkyHelper($a, $b, $c).  Zend_View_Abstract::getHelper($name) does a "new $class()", in this case "new FunkyHelper()" and FunkyHelper::funkyHelper() is called as a php4-style constructor. As funkyHelper($a, $b, $c) expects three parameters this results in an exception.</p>

<p>That's why I think empty helper prefixes should not be allowed.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Empty helper prefixes have been disallowed in 1.5.</p>

<p>In 1.6, the helper system inside Zend_View_Abstract will be replaced with Zend_Loader_PluginLoader (much like in Zend_Filter_Inflector as well as the usage you see in Zend_Form).  In general, not having a prefix is both a bad practice as well as confusing.  The naming structure we have (pseudo-namespaces/PEAR naming conventions) is the only thing we have until php gets real namespaces.</p>
