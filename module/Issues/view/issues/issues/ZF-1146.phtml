    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When trying to assign readonly to a view helper such as formText it is translated into a type="hidden" automatically.</p>

<p>$this-&gt;formText('city', $this-&gt;directory-&gt;city, array('readonly' =&gt; 'readonly'))</p>

<p>becomes:</p>

            <p>Looking further into this it appears that this was done intentionally. I can't find a Zend_View or Zend_View_Helper proposal, so I'm not sure why the disable code exists. My guess would be that initially this fuctionallity was intended to be able disable a form as a whole, and then wasn't implimented fully or correctly. Each of the individual form helpers is coded to check $disable and take action.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
    public function formText($name, $value = null, $attribs = null)
    {
        $info = $this-&gt;_getInfo($name, $value, $attribs);
        extract($info); // name, value, attribs, options, listsep, disable
        
        // build the element
        if ($disable) {
            // disabled
            $xhtml = $this-&gt;_hidden($name, $value)
                   . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8');
        } else {
            // enabled
            $xhtml = '_htmlAttribs($attribs)
                   . ' /&gt;';
        }
        
        return $xhtml;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe the feeling was that this was a more universally excepted by browsers, I clearly don't know. But it is preventing me from getting the desired behavior and appears to be a bug.</p>

            <p>Behaviour fixed in r4320. 'readonly' attrib now correctly set to 'readonly', and the element is no longer disabled.</p>

            <p>This is minor. There is a comment in the code in FormElement.php  that no longer applies.</p>

<ul><li>Note that you cannot pass a 'disable' param'; you need to pass</li>
<li>it as an 'attribs' key. A "'readonly' =&gt; 'readonly'" attribs</li>
<li>key-value pair has the same effect as "'disable' =&gt; true".</li>
