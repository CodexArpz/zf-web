    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>If {{Zend_Date}} provided {{public}} (i.e. PHP {{public}}) methods for obtaining the parts of a date and creating dates from these parts, then ZF developers would have an alternative to PHP's {{mktime()}} and {{getdate()}} that work well with Zend_Date objects.  There are many ways to enable such functionality in Zend_Date.</p>

<p>Reasons for supporting these two methods in Zend_Date include:</p>

<h1>Convenience (developers don't have to extract timestamps, use PHP's functions, and then create a new Zend_Date object)</h1>

<h1>Consistency (Zend_Date API becomes more complete and consistent)</h1>

<h1>Allows developers to do more with Zend_Date, without subclassing Zend_Date (i.e. convenience, and portability of code - code can be shared easier with other ZF projects)</h1>

<h1>PHP functions do not support 64-bit timestamps, but Zend_Date does support 64-bit timestamps, which is a very cool feature :)</h1>

            <p>to 1) Why should a user use PHP's functions.... Zend_Date has all a user needs. 
to 2) Zend_Date is consistent... the API is feature rich, simple to use and has no known problems.
to 3) Zend_Date has more than 100 functions... I dont think that "more" is necessary
to 4) it's PHP's fault not to support 64bit timestamps ;-)</p>

<p>I will not give access to the internal mktime or getdate function to prevent the illusion that they are 100% identical to the php functions.</p>

<p>But I see the possible benefit to have Zend_Date extracted as array and have an array as input.
First is already implemented with getDateParts() and will become public.
For the details on the second I have to think about.</p>

            <p>1) Agreed, but it would be nice if the developer had easier access (no need to create subclasses) :)
2) Zend_Date API is missing public methods equivalent to PHP's {{mkdate()}} and {{getdate()}}.
3) 100 functions, but see 2) above.
4) Agreed!</p>

<p>{quote}I will not give access to the internal mktime or getdate function to prevent the illusion that they are 100% identical to the php functions.{quote}</p>

<p>Yes, there are many ways to provide 2) above that do not require exposing internal functions.
It would be convenient if Zend_Date had a method similar to {{getdate()}} and the output of this method could be used as input to Zend_Date's method for creating date objects from these parts.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$dateParts = Zend_Date::now()-&gt;getArrayOfDateParts();
$dateObject = Zend_Date::mkDateObject($dateParts);
</code></pre>

<p>I chose silly long method names to avoid confusion with any existing methods.  The public methods could be all new, or some type of proxy to internal methods, or by making an internal method public.  I am only trying to suggest the usefulness of allowing the output of one function to be used as the input for the other function (making date objects).</p>

            <p>Added the new function toArray() which returns an array representation of the actual date object.
Equal to PHP's getDate() function.</p>

<p>Creation of dates from an array will come in the future.</p>
