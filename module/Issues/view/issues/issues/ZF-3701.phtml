    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Due to the many private variables in the Zend_Pdf classes, it is not possible to extend these classes.</p>

<p>For example, if i wanted to use an extended version of the Zend_Pdf_Page class, i would have to extend Zend_Pdf too, since the $page object is created from within this class. However, for this operation the private $this-&gt;_objFactory variable is needed. Dead end.
Suppose we solve this problem and we succesfully overload the newPage() method with our own extended version of Zend_Pdf() (so it creates a page object of the extended Zend_Pdf_Page class) and now we want to overload the drawText() method to make it more flexibel. Again, we bump into all sorts of private variables like $this-&gt;_font and, worse, $this-&gt;_contents! Since $this-&gt;_contents doesn't have a getter or a setter it is impossible to ever extend the Zend_Pdf_Page class, because you won't be able to add content. So, more dead ends.
There are even private methods like _addProcSet() that you won't be able to use.</p>

            <p>This is very serious problem which downgrade OOP principes. In OOP world a single document like booking voucher should be extended from PDF class.</p>
