    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When running a MVC application under FastCGI with Apache, there seems to be an issue with the application not being able to find the necessary controller files, even when the controller directory has been properly set.</p>

<p>I set up a simple "hello world" application according to the quick start formula in the Zend Controller documentation as a way of testing. The bootstrap consisted of three simple parts: 1. a set_include_path function that sets the absolute include path to the Zend framework files, 2. a require_once for Zend/Controller/Front.php, and 3. the Zend_Controller_Front::run() static method to which I passed the absolute path to the application's controllers directory. The directory set up is the standard controller, models, views format. There is an indexController.php file and an errorController.php file in the controllers directory and each of these have corresponding .phtml files in the views/scripts/index and views/scripts/error directories. So all the required files are there and are properly named. All the permissions and paths have been checked.</p>

<p>When I ran this test application I received a Zend exception with the message invalid controller specified(error). However, if I included a require_once line above the run method with the full path to indexController.php, the test application ran as it should. I have also run the hello world application on my local machine where php is running as an Apache module and it ran fine without modifications.</p>

<p>I have run this test application on the Stanford University server elaine.stanford.edu as well as on the Joyent server madrone.joyent.us. Both of these servers are running php 5.2 and using the CGI/FastCGI api. Both returned the same exception. The fact that this happened on both servers makes me think that this is not specific to a particular server configuration. It seems to be a general problem with the framework and FastCGI.</p>

<p>I have poured over the source code, but I do not have enough php experience to determine exactly where the error is occurring. My hypothesis is that the problem lies somewhere in the Zend_Controller_Request_Http class, since there are several methods in that class that use $_SERVER variables. However, this is at best a guess. Perhaps the request object is not providing Zend_Loader with the path it needs to load the controller files?</p>

<p>If you would like more information on the configuration at Stanford University, you can check of the following phpinfo file:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/medieval/cgi-bin/phpinfo.php">http://stanford.edu/dept/medieval/…</a></p>

<p>Information on the joyent configuration can be found at:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.redrobyn.com/clients/medieval/public/info.php">http://redrobyn.com/clients/medieval/…</a></p>

<p>If you need more specific information, I am in contact with the system administrators at both Stanford and Joyent. They can provide me with any additional parameters you might require.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

            <p>this is a non-issue. Turns out I was following the old Zend Controller documentation which suggested that controller names needed to be camelCased. However, because the dispatcher dynamically constructs controller file names using an initial capital, camel cased controller names will not work on case-sensitive systems. It might be good to make a note in the current documentation about this. It should be specified that controller names need to start with a capital.</p>

<p>Sorry about the red herring.</p>
