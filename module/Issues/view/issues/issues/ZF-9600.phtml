    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Presently, in order to use the cache, one must disable Zend_App's own output buffering in the following fashion (also for using Zend_Cache_Page):</p>

<p>resources.frontController.params.disableOutputBuffering = true</p>

<p>However, this is not documented. After talking with MWOP it was his suggestion that the cache automatically do this on behalf of the user.</p>

            <p>Will talk to Matthew for surety - I can't remember from the maze of Zend_Controller what impacts this has/does not have in relation to other components. Worse, I haven't the slightest idea how Zend_Cache can go off the reservation to impact Zend_Controller like that. Sounds like a static FC call which I really don't want to add to an independent component. What does worry me is why is it not documented? I could swear I submitted these in the docs, and even edited the Page docs to reflect it.</p>

            <p>It's documented for the Page Frontend (in a note). I'll add in the Capture frontend in a while - must have missed a commit somewhere when I was adding these notes.</p>

            <p>The required setting is documented, but imposing a coupled call between two components is not a good idea (at present). Maybe ZF 2.0 will make this easier.</p>
