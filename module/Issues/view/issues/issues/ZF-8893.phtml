    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The Send method of Zend_Feed_Atom and Zend_Feed_Rss both prevent the addition of headers other than the content-type header.
This prevents the sending of headers in situations such as implementing a REST interface, where you need to send response codes such as 201 for a successful post.</p>

<p>Good solutions could involve either adding additional headers to be sent by the Zend_Feed object, or accepting a response object which could be preconfigured with the appropriate headers and used to send the http response.</p>

            <p>I get all the good ones...:P</p>

<p>Will look into modifying the method. Most likely solution is accepting an array of additional errors - we're down to keeping fixes situational and simple for Zend_Feed. If possible, I strongly suggest handling headers outside of Zend_Feed. To get it absolutely perfect would require a lot of work the component should not, to be honest, be concerned about.</p>

            <p>Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend_Feed_Reader/Zend_Feed_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.</p>
