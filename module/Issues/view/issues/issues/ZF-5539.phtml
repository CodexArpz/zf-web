    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>It is obvious that you spent a lot of time creating this framework.  It seems like you will end up with a marvelous piece of software.</p>

<p>However, if you had spent 1/10 of this time creating useful documentation, use-case examples, and how-to guides.... a lot of us would be sailing on this ship instead of Cake or Sierra.</p>

<p>As it is, I spent 8 days learning how to authenticate with the Zend Framework, and have spent another week trying to get dbTables to work.    Both of these tasks are TRIVIAL on other frameworks.</p>

<p>In your online documentation and "examples" each and every one did authentication in  a different and incongruent way.  Your PhpDocs fail to give complete information including method signatures and result types.  I had to use var_dump to learn that AuthStorage returns "stdObject" that has to be cast to array.</p>

<p>All of your meager examples are completely discrete, none of them build upon the previous example.  They are all from different versions of Zend, and do nothing at all to help us learn how to build a reasonable application.  Even your quickstart applications fails to build upon previous examples, instead each example does everything completely differently than the previous example.</p>

<p>There are no books published on Zend Framework that are useful at all, and your PhpDocs fail to give complete information.</p>

<p>We are rolling out a major product, and we cannot afford this kind of problem, so barring a major breakthrough in the next 5 days, we will be flying with either Cake or Sierra PHP.</p>

<p>We might check back in a year or two... but you missed out on this project because you spent WAY too little time developing the kind of material that developers need in order to put your framework to use.  Take a lesson from Microsoft... they COURT developers with extensive WELL THOUGHT OUT AND DEPLOYED documentation, examples, use-case examples etc.  They don't just throw a complete barrage of mish-mashed, outdated, unrelated examples into a barrel and stir it up.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to have to DIG for practical code examples that they can use to learn a framework.</p>

<p>(There are even "podcasts" on your site that are from deprecated versions of the framework, and have technical difficulties where the video is broken and the presenter can be heard saying "I am sorry the video is not working, but let me tell you what you SHOULD be seeing on your screen right now".....    How amateruish is that?)</p>

<p>When I compare this incompetent documentation with the relatively well produced "Php.net" I am frankly amazed that it comes from the same organization.....</p>

            <p>We are building this framework in our sparetime, we get not paid for it.</p>

<p>There is no reason why you have to be so rude.
The people who are writing the documentation are no authors or professional writers. Many of them even don't have english as native language. All who commit to ZF are no employees of Zend. The only relation is the name and the project head.</p>

<p>I am glad that so many "private" people are creating such an amazing framework.</p>

<p>And you can not say that it's our fault that there are not much books about ZF.
Books are written by other authors and publishing companies which are not related to the community nor to Zend themself.</p>

<p>Same is guilty for Blogs from people... they are also not related to Zend. You can't blame us committers for the failures of blogger / private people.</p>

<p>And as always:
Instead of mocking people could simply help us and increase the manual instead of just saying that it does not fit your needs. :-)</p>

            <p>Please don't blame other people for your own lack of programming experience. If it takes you two weeks to get basic authentication done I would suggest you invest in training your basic development skills.</p>

<p>Regarding the books. Have a look at Rob Allen's Zend Framework In Action. It definitely is useful and will guide you through setting up authentication in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>A lot of people use ZF (with pleasure), and do not encounter the problems you describe. It has never been said that the documentation is impeccable, but it is surely useful.</p>

<p>If you see that the documention is wrong somewhere please add an issue on that specific part, instead of saying "the documentation is off".</p>

<p>There is by the way also training for ZF certification, as well as commercial support by Zend.</p>

            <p>OK, I do work for Zend, so I can address some of the points you bring up. Which podcast are you referring to? Please paste in a link so I can look in to it. You should also be aware that, while Zend hosts the ZF project, we do not host php.net. We obviously make important contributions to PHP, but we can't take the credit for php.net. :)
As for the documentation issues, you have some great feedback. Could you please create an issue for each of your specific issues with the documentation, so that we can address as soon as we can. We are currently working with our publishing partner, Apress, on reviewing the entire manual and improving it. Your input would help a lot. Please keep in mind that only one issue should be logged in each issue in the issue tracker. This helps with bookkeeping. Also keep in mind that issues are not the place for editorial comments about general framework shortcomings. I would recommend the mailing lists for such comments.
There are several books that have come out in the last few months. Can you tell me which books you've tried and what you don't like about them? Please email me at wil at zend.
Finally, many of your concerns may be addressed with Zend_Tool, which will be included in the next minor release.</p>

<p>Thanks!
,Wil</p>
