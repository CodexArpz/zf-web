            <p>Maghiel: How can you check other languages? Do you speak 8 different languages? ;-)</p>

<p>Hint:
When the source changes than also the translation will change.
In german for example "has be" and "has been" have different meaning in translation. And many other languages behave the same way. So simply changing the source is not correct as long as you are not a native russian speaker.</p>

            <p>@Thomas: clear! I assumed it was just a simple question of a miss-spelled key. 
(I still think it's a misspelled key, as all languages contained the same source, except for Russian. But I cannot be sure so you're definatly right i cannot resolve this issue).</p>

<p>Well then Reopened and unassigned from me :p</p>

            <p>Thomas, the key differs from the value. The value should obviously be checked by someone who speaks Russian (pref. natively. Alex?), but the keys should be the same in all language files.</p>

            <p>Dolf:
The unittest shows that the key differs from the original english resource.</p>

<p>This means that the translation has been made by using a wrong key. Therefor also the value has to be seen as incorrect as long as it has been verified by a russian speaking person.</p>

            <p>Correct, but then it still makes sense to at least correct the key?</p>

            <p>No one corrected the key, because then the value is incorrect.
And thats the reason why the unittest fails.</p>

<p>I don't get your problem.</p>

<p>To be on the correct side we could in the meantime delete the related key/value pair, but why making the work of others more problematic?</p>

            <p>@Saturo:
Note that when you would have done this for german, then you would have broken the validation as the meaning for the translation would have changed.</p>

<p>Please note that only a native translator should change the key and value pair, otherwise the validation is surely broken.</p>
