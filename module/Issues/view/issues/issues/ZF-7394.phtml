    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Filter_Input disregards custom error messages passed to it via the 'messages' meta-command. This has been working previously but has been broken since the 1.8 ver. release.</p>

<p>For example, the following validators array:</p>

<pre><code>   $validators = array(
    'name' =&gt; array('NotEmpty','messages' =&gt; 'Please enter your name'),
    'subject' =&gt; array('NotEmpty','messages' =&gt; 'Please enter a subject'),
    'email' =&gt; array('EmailAddress','messages' =&gt; 'Please enter a valid Email address'),
    'content' =&gt; array('NotEmpty','messages' =&gt; 'Please enter message contents')
);
</code></pre>

<p>Returns the following message stack:</p>

<p>array(5) {
  ["name"] =&gt; array(1) {
    ["isEmpty"] =&gt; string(48) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'name'"
  }
  ["subject"] =&gt; array(1) {
    ["isEmpty"] =&gt; string(51) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'subject'"
  }
  ["content"] =&gt; array(1) {
    ["isEmpty"] =&gt; string(51) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'content'"
  }
  ["email"] =&gt; array(1) {
    [0] =&gt; string(24) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'content''"
  }
}</p>

            <p>@Julien:  that's not quite my experience. Consider:</p>

<p>$validators = array(
     'email' =&gt; array(
             'NotEmpty',
             'EmailAddress',
            new Zend_Validate_Regex('/.+nys[dp].uscourts.gov$/i'),
             'messages'=&gt;array(
                      'Email is required',
                      'Email address is malformed',
                      'Email domain must be either nysd.uscourts.gov or nysp.uscourts.gov'),
            'breakChainOnFailure'=&gt;true,</p>

<pre><code>         ),
</code></pre>

<p>);
$input = new Zend_Filter_Input(null,$validators,
    array(
        'email'=&gt;'barf'
    )
);</p>

<p>if (! $input-&gt;isValid()) {
    print_r($input-&gt;getMessages());
}</p>

<p>outputs the default error message instead of the one I (try to) pass in:</p>

<p>(
    [email] =&gt; Array
        (
            [emailAddressInvalidFormat] =&gt; 'barf' is not a valid email address in the basic format local-part@hostname
        )</p>

You don't use the same notation as Eran...
Your problem is different than Eran's.</p>

            <p>I don't quite understand why it would matter. It looks like my general problem is "it doesn't work," i.e., can't get Zend_Filter_Input to let me override the default error messages when there's more than one rule on a field. In any case, is my issue something already in the tracker or should I file one? And... do you know if there are any plans to address this issue and/or mine?</p>

            <p>*) When something is different coded than also the issue is different
*) That it does not work is not true... using another notation there is no problem at all
*) There is already another issue for your notation... a simple search would have shown you this
*) As you have seen I took over this issue 6 days ago
*) I can not solve 80 issues at the same time so please be patient as already mentioned several times... one after the oher will be solved</p>

            <p>*) Reasonable minds may disagree, but I would respectfully submit that when code that conforms to the documented API runs faultlessly in one version of the ZF but generates undesired output in a subsequent version, it can fairly be said that something "doesn't work," and
*) I searched in good faith for the issue, with negative results, perhaps because
*) your understanding of the issues greatly exceeds my own, which is why you're a contributor and I, a mere consumer, who

            <p>@David:    LOL</p>

<p>Let's say: I will solve them soon, ok ?</p>

<p>Your issue is related to ZF-7034 (using one element with multiple validators and messages). Internally I have fixed it already so there is a solution for it soon.</p>

<p>This issue (using multiple elements with one validator and message) could be fixed but I can only verify when I've finished the other one.</p>

<p>When all is ok, then there is a solution within one day. Does this sound good to you ? ;-)</p>
