    <div class="body">
        <p>I found a bug while using Zend_Date and '0000-00-00 00:00:00' Mysql DateTimes.</p>

<p>Here is a test snippet to reproduce the bug:
&lt;? 
require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
$d = new Zend_Date('0000-00-00 00:00:00' ,'YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');
echo $d-&gt;toString('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');

            <p>Actually this is not really a problem...</p>

<p>A date with month set to 0 and day set to 0 is not a date and almost impossible.
Month must be between 1 and 12 for example</p>

<p>If you expect to get impossible date values you should use isDate instead of creating a date and receiving an exception.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Btw:
As the year value is "-1" and you define that it must be filled with zeros up to 4 positions you will always get "00-1" in return...</p>

<p>ISO defines the filling of values only for positive values. Negative values should always be output without filling.</p>

            <p>Month 0 results in last year and Month 12
Day 0 results in one month befor and last day of this month</p>

<p>So the result of Year 0, Month 0, Day 0 is always print out as</p>

<p>-1.11.30</p>

<p>This is not a issue, it's the automatic correction of false dates which occurs automatically.</p>

            <p>This date is maybe not valid in your sense. But, it is valid in most cases. We use a mecanism which implements Dao/Dto pattern  and we have usecases where datetimes are set to '0000-00-00 00:00:00' by default and we can't change this behaviour. Moreover if you want to deal with past years, '0000-00-00  00:00:00' seems not that impossible. For example, if you want to make the Jesus Christ Chronology. But, the worse is that many companies use '0000-00-00 00:00:00' as a replacement for 'default' in SGBDs.
To conclude, i understand your pov on the date correction, but there the correstion must not appen, this date is valid.</p>

            <p>Then try simply this code:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>pre class="highlight"&gt;<code>
&lt;?php
print "</code></p>

<pre>";
print "\nMKTIME";
print "\nORIG: DAY:00  MONTH:00  YEAR:2000";
$time = mktime(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2000);
print "\nREAL: DAY:".date('d',$time)."  MONTH:".date('m',$time)."  YEAR:".date('Y',$time);
</pre>

<p>What you will get is not
00  00  2000
you will get
30 11 1999</p>

<p>And exactly this is what Zend_Date does with a wrong date. It will be automatically corrected. Otherwise we would not be able to calculate them.
When you say that you want a textual represenation of the real date you will of course not get the original date returned but you will get the corrected date. And "toString" always returned a valid date.</p>

<p>As all databases I know are not able to handle dates with negative year values the simplest solution for you would be to check if the year of the returned date is below 0... which then implies that you gave the default date.</p>

<p>But again... this is a behaviour which will not be changed by Zend_Date.
If we would switch off the correction also dates like 
"0000-199--6599 1534:6245:-46" would be correct.</p>

<p>If you are in need of handling also illegal dates you can extend Zend_Date or handle them before you initiate Zend_Date or use a mechanism as described above disallowing negative dates which automatically will be recognised as default date.</p>

<p>And related to Jesus Christ Chronology... he was born on the 24.december.-1... and not the 0th 0th whatever month this should be. :-)</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Btw: 
From the MySQL 5 docu:</p>

<p>The DATETIME type is used when you need values that contain both date and time information. MySQL retrieves and displays DATETIME values in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format. The supported range is '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.</p>

<p>So a date '0000-00-00 00:00:00' is not possible directly with MySQL datetime... ;-)</p>

            <p>Yes, i understand your pov, we ll make some workarounds for the '0000-00:00 00:00:00' case.</p>

<p>But in any cases, Mysql is permissive and our existing projects abuse of it.</p>

<p>Demo :
Your MySQL connection id is 1
Server version: 5.0.44-log Gentoo Linux mysql-5.0.44
mysql&gt; create table stuff (t datetime);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.36 sec)</p>

<p>mysql&gt; insert into stuff values('0000-00-00 00:00:00');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</p>

<p>mysql&gt; select * from stuff;
+---------------------+
| t                   |
+---------------------+
| 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</p>

            <p>This just means that the official documentation of MySQL 5 is not correct.</p>

<p>But this has no effect to this issue.
I know no date implementation from any language which will deliberately output false dates.</p>
