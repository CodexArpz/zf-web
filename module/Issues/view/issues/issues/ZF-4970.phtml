            <p>Please let me know by when can this be fixed. Its required to use multiple checkboxes which is a standard use case.</p>

            <p>Actually, we're typically not going to support dojox features from Zend_Dojo, as their stability cannot be counted on.</p>

<p>There are features for 1.8 that will make it potentially possible for you to consume arbitrary dijits/dojox components, as well as make it easy to create your own view helpers for targettting them.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm closing the issue, as it's not likely we will directly implement the component.</p>

            <p>When is ver 1.8 released?
I didn't see the dates in the calender for 1.8
If you specify the date, I can schedule things accordingly.</p>

            <p>Please note that I said we'll have a helper for consuming <em>arbitrary</em> dijits ready for 1.8, not for the requested dijit. 1.8 will likely be sometime in April, but we do not have a hard date yet.</p>

<p>BTW, we are open to having dojox view helpers/form elements/decorators in ZendX; we simply won't be supporting them directly with the standard library.</p>
