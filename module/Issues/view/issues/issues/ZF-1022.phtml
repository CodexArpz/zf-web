Subject:    [fw-mvc] Suggestion: Vary Support in Request/Response Objects
Date:   Thu, 01 Mar 2007 13:52:00 -0800
From:   Gavin Vess <a href="mailto:gavin@zend.com">gavin@zend.com</a>

<p>Applications that vary content based on HTTP request headers ought to 
alert the receivers of such content using a "Vary" header in the response.
Otherwise, caching proxy servers might serve the wrong cached content.</p>

<p>An application might choose to alter content based on the request's HTTP 
Accept header, such as language, character set, encoding, or based on 
the user agent.  For cache control headers that permit caching the 
response, without an appropriate "vary" header in the response, a 
caching proxy server normally assumes the response should be the same 
for every user agent accessing the same URL (considering only HTTP GET 
in this email).</p>

<p>Is there value in supporting something like the following?</p>

<p>$response-&gt;varyByLanguage(true);
$response-&gt;varyByCharset(true);
$response-&gt;varyByUserAgent(true);
etc.</p>

<p>Then the response object could inject appropriate headers.</p>

<p>Simply accessing this information from the request object could throw a 
yellow flag that the "Vary" header might be needed.  For those who like 
a little help in big applications, if the request object recorded access 
of these values, flags could be toggled to help developers decide 
whether or not to "Vary:" by which type.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Gavin</p>

<p>P.S. For reference, here is an example:</p>

<p>[HTTP_ACCEPT] =&gt; text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,<em>/</em>;q=0.5
   [HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET] =&gt; ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
   [HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING] =&gt; gzip,deflate
   [HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] =&gt; en-us,en;q=0.5
   [HTTP_USER_AGENT] =&gt; Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.10) Gecko/20070216 Firefox/1.5.0.10</p>

  <p>Very cool; maybe a method for Zend_Locale to integrate into

  <p>-&gt;setVariedResponse() or a better name?</p>

    <p>Perhaps some will find it valuable to elaborate a little more about 
    the issues of serving different content at the same URL based on the 
    value of the HTTP "accept-language" request header.</p>
    
    <p>How many crawlers crawl the same URLs multiple times, once for every 
    language they want to "find" at the URL by setting the value of the 
    "Accept-Language" HTTP request header to each language in turn?
    When viewing search results, how many search engines show multiple 
    versions of a web page for the same URL, with each "version" in one 
    of the languages supported by that website?  The search engine might 
    make educated guesses about the language preference of the user 
    searching, or it might not.</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦</a> - HTTP 1.1 and 
    the "Vary" header</p>
    
    <p>When varying content based on the request field "accept-language", 
    make sure to use the "vary" HTTP header in the response:
    Vary: Accept-Language</p>
    
    <p>This is quite important to prevent other issues with caching proxy 
    servers (e.g. the multitudes using AOL and similar setups):
       <a href="http://webmaster.info.aol.com/vary.html">http://webmaster.info.aol.com/vary.html</a> - AOL's instructions</p>
