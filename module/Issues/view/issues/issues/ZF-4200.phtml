    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Previously in 1.5 it is  set in the registry a new Locale object in the boot strap, which follows on from the manual. This should be made aware in classes such as Zend_currency. However after upgrading to 1..6 the error message is thrown,</p>

<p>I have tried setting differnet locales, en_GB, en_US, but both don't work. Messed around with php.ini settings, but still doesn't work, and the problem occurs when actually constructing a new zend_currency object. Soon as it does this the program fails.</p>

<p>Also have tried setting php locale to en_GB, but still doesn't work.</p>

<p>However, I can revert back to 1.5 libraries straight away and works.</p>

<p>Can this problem be solved.</p>

<p>Let me paraphrase this clearly:</p>

<p>Please look in the manual, this is what I attempt to do; at section 27.1.8, example : 27.9
url: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.html#zend.locale.frameworkwidelocale">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a></p>

<p>I explicitly do that but instead of constructing a zend_date i construct a zend_currency instead.</p>

<p>P.S sorry, I should have put example, or  least with section. Innocent mistake, thankyou for your patience.</p>

            <p>Regarding to your failure message you gave the locale 'en' to Zend_Currency and not en_US or en_GB.
Within the exception message always the given locale will be returned.</p>

<p>As "en" does not contain region informations it will throw an exception.
This was already in past the case.</p>

<p>Check your locale definition.</p>

            <p>I don't think so... :-)</p>

<p>Section 27.9 does not exists. After 27.5 comes 28.
Please give a reproducable example when you can not refer to the online manual.</p>

            <p>This does only work when you are using the trunk or ZF 1.7.
The dev-team has decided to delay this feature until 1.7.</p>

<p>So you eighter update to SVN trunk, wait until 1.7 or set the locale manually for each object.</p>
