    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>While using the Zend_Dojo component, I have found it rather tedious to have call registerModule when using addDijit. Since each dijit requires a dojoType to be specified it should be possible to have the module of the dijit registered automatically, just as it does when creating a dijit through the view helper interface.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we'd probably need to make the protected members _dijit and _module of the dijits either constants or provide a public accessor method to retrieve these values.</p>

<p>I believe constants would be the best method as we wouldn't have to instantiate the objects to retrieve these values during the addDijit call.</p>

            <p>addDijit() is primarily for use by the various dijit view helpers. Can you present the use case where you're calling it in your own code?</p>
