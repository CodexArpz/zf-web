    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>The isReadable method in Zend_Loader does an fopen on the filename to see if it is readable. Any errors are ignored by a preceding @. If a custom error-handler is defined, it will still be triggered though which is very annoying.</p>

<p>It can be easily fixed by first doing a file_exists() before attempting to open it.</p>

<p>Of course it can be reasoned the programmer should do this step himself, before asking if a file is readable. In that case Zend_Load_PluginLoader::load() (and possibly other methods in the framework) should be adjusted and do the file_exists() before calling isReadable.</p>

            <p>The algorithm for Zend_Loader::isReadable() was updated for 1.10.1, and removed the error suppression operator (fopen() is no longer used).</p>

<p>Please always check against the most current version before creating reports to see if the issue still exists.</p>

            <p>Ah, my mistake then.</p>

<p>This bug had been bothering me for a while. I recently downloaded the latest version and found it still existed but hadn't come around filing the bug report yet. I didn't think a new version had already been released in the short timespace since, let alone one that had discovered the bug and fixed it :-) What are the odds!</p>

<p>I'll be more careful next time ;-)</p>
