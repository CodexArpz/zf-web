    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Today, we were talking about St. Patrick's Day being on a Saturday this year while we were eating lunch.  Someone said it didn't happen that often.  Then, after a brief discussion, we all started writing some code to find out when St. Patrick's Day would occur on a Saturday over the next century or so.</p>

<p>Initially, I used mktime() to generate the timestamp that was used by date() to display the day of the week.  It worked well until 2038, in which case it began to fail.</p>

<p>Then, I decided to use Zend_Date.  Here's the code I used:
            for ($x = 1971; $x &lt; 2108; $x++) {
                $spd = new Zend_Date(mktime());
                $spd-&gt;setYear($x);
                $spd-&gt;setMonth(3);
                $spd-&gt;setDay(17);
                $wd = $spd-&gt;toString('EEEE');
                echo "{$x}: St. Patrick's Day falls on " . ($wd == "Saturday" ? "<b>" : '') . $wd . ($wd == "Saturday" ? "</b>" : '') . "<br />";
            }</p>

<p>The problem occurs at or after 2038.  The next St. Patrick Day that should fall on a Saturday should be in 2040, not 2041.  (Several other calendars seem to concur.)  All of the calculations on/after 2038 seem to be bad.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this has to do with leap years after 2038, since they all seem to be off by one day, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you need any additional information.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Travis</p>
