    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Downloaded the full package (stable) and uploaded only the library folder to my linux server.
It said that it could not find the RegEx.php. This was true, since the E was not capitalized.
Maybe its my unzipper who did this, but it happened on Windows XP to afterwards.</p>

            <p>Actually within Zend_Framework the file is named
"Regex.php"... not the lowercased "e".</p>

<p>Normally Windows has no problems using lower- or uppercase names as it's case independent.</p>

<p>From where you ever have this information I don't know.
But Zend_Validate_Regex is lowercased since it has been released to core.</p>
