    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>testAdapterTransactionCommit() and testAdapterTransactionRollback() are currently skipped for DB2 with the message: "DB2 has a problem with concurrent access to the same table"</p>

<p>DB2 is actually behaving as designed as there are special considerations to be taken into account to show true concurrency within the same process:</p>

<p><a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/admin/r0001917.htm">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/…</a>
<a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.apdv.embed.doc/doc/c0006107.htm">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/…</a></p>

<p>As a suggestion, $dbConnection2 can use an isolation level of "uncommitted read".  It will be able to read the data even before $dbConnection1 has commited, but as the name implies, it will be seeing the new updated, though not committed data.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
$dbConnection2-&gt;getConnection();
$dbConnection2-&gt;query('SET ISOLATION LEVEL = UR');
</code></pre>

<p>Accordingly, the asserts in testAdapterTransactionCommit() and testAdapterTransactionRollback() would need to be changed to show that $dbConnection2 is seeing the changes done by $dbconnection1.</p>

<p>The final asserts after the transaction ends or is rolled back show that $dbConnection2 is seeing what was committed or rolledback as expected.</p>

<p>I will upload DB2Test.php with the changes.  Please review and incorporate as appropriate.</p>

            <p>Applied patch in revision 6014.</p>

<p>DB2 apparently has pretty limited support for concurrency.  Unfortunate.  But this is a patch to unit tests that are testing whether {{commit()}} and {{rollback()}} are working.  That goal has been met.</p>

            <p>NOTE:  this test will be a bit more complex in the PDO_IBM adapter, because it supports both DB2 and XPS.  From what I have read, DB2 uses syntax "SET ISOLATION LEVEL = UR", but XPS has syntax "SET ISOLATION LEVEL TO DIRTY READ".</p>
