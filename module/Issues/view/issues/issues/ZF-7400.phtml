    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>When using the ActiveMQ adapter, this error is presented at the end of the test script:</p>

<p>Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0</p>

<p>I suspect it is because the resource $this-&gt;_socket has already been closed.  However, as to why it throws the error is a mystery to me.</p>

<p>The culprit code is at:</p>

<p>trunk/library/Zend/Queue/Stomp/Client/Connection.php function close()</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>The solution to this (to comment-out the "close socket" line in the Stomp/Client/Connection.php file) is causing us some problems, as we're opening and closing a lot of connections in a single process.  However, as they're not being closed, the ActiveMQ server is running out of file handles and dying :(</p>

<p>Any chance that a better solution to this can be found, and start actually closing the socket in the "close()" function?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I am aware of this bug, but I don't know what the solution is.</p>

<p>I have also gotten some code together, but not yet tested to reduce the connection count, but I'm putting a lot of work hours.</p>
