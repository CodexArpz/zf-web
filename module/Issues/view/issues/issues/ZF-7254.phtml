    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Trying to get started with zend, I downloaded it and began with your tutorial.  It didn't take long to find some problems.  This is the first.</p>

<p><a href="http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-your-project">http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦</a></p>

<p>Not really a problem necessarily, but it is to someone new and unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Right out of the box, if you test the error handling (by putting in an erroneous url for example) you get a nonsensical error message.  Why?  Because code like "</p>

<h2>&lt;?= $this-&gt;message ?&gt;</h2>

<p>" is going to output "</p>

<h2>-&gt;message ?&gt;</h2>

<p>" because a default php installation isn't going to know what the heck &lt;?= means.  Changing it to "&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;message ?&gt;" of course results in what the user would expect.</p>

<p>I'm just beginning.  Maybe in the (very near) future it will become obvious why &lt;?= is outputted but step 1 tutorial should result in step 1 success.  Not "huh"?</p>

<p>Suggestion:  either change the code to something that will work immediately, or explain to the user that it will work later (if something is configured later) or how to configure their php to recognize that kind of output (if not).</p>

<p>Cake and Symfony both also suffer from step 1 tutorial failure.  None give much confidence.  Before you laugh and call this extremely minor... think who the tutorial is for and look at it from their point of view.</p>

            <p>We have already made a decision to standardize all documentation and tutorials to use normal, long tags; unfortunately, the output from Zend_Tool and the QuickStart are out-of-date. Both are fixed in SVN currently, and you will see the changes with the next release.</p>
