    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Sometimes, when using the insertEntry method to upload a video to youtube, I get an exception "Invalid Request", but the video is actually uploaded succesfully. This is obviously inconsistent: if the video was uploaded succesfully, no exception must be thrown, while if the request is invalid, then the video wouldn't be uploaded.</p>

<p>However wrong the request may be, giving a negative response and at the same time satisfying the request is buggy behavior.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether the bug is actually in the library, or in YouTube's API itself, if it is actually returning a response saying "invalid request" and at the same time accepting and publishing the uploaded video.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't provide a series of steps to reproduce the issue: this just seems to happen randomly.</p>
