    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm pretty sure this ticket will get rejected, but I'll share my thoughts.</p>

<p>Zend_Controller_Front &amp; Zend_Registry both use a mono-dim singleton pattern and as such two independent apps based on Zend Framework cannot be called one within the other (nested calls).</p>

<p>For example, I've got a modular application, made of lots of independent plugins. This main application is based on ZF. If a third party plugin is submited and based itself on ZF too, then call to third party plugins fail because Zend_Controller_Front already exists and is configured prior to even calling the plugin.</p>

<p>My workaround for now is to wrap plugins into a webservice so that they are run as independent processes, but it's not very easy to share php variables that way.</p>

<p>I thought it could be interesting (and give greater flexibility to ZF) for ZF to natively allow nested front controller instances (and registry instances too).
This could be done as follow:
 - Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance() would store a stack of instances (instead of a single instance as of today), same with zend_registry
 - a method such as $front-&gt;allowNewInstance(true|false) could be implemented (by default set to false on any new instance), when parameter is boolean true, this means "on next call to Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance(), serve a brand new instance" while false would mean "serve already instanciated controller on top of stack"
 - and two static methods still on the front controller: Zend_Controller_Front::getStackIndex() (return count($front_controller_stack) - 1) and Zend_Controller_Front::restoreStackIndex(int $level) (this method is used to restore the process to the level we left it when we called $front-&gt;allowNewInstance()</p>

<p>Starting from there, each value of stack_index represents the number of nested ZF currently runnings, and calling app has control over plugins (allowing new front controller instances upon calling each plugin, and reseting stack index to its value after each plugin call).
Then other classes based on singleton pattern (such as zend registry) could call Zend_Controller_Front::getStackIndex() and determine wether or not they should server a new instance upon ::getInstance() call or serve an already existing one.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Remy</p>

<p>PS: by the way, how do we re-open tickets (can we? or do we need a special account | special rights?). I tried to reopen <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4370">http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4370</a> by adding a new comment but it's still closed</p>

            <p>Many of the issues you're describing are addressed with Zend_Application, which provides excellent support out of the box for modules, including the ability to bootstrap modules prior to execution.</p>

<p>We do plan to eliminate the singleton in the front controller, but not until 2.0. There will be a proposal when we prepare to do so; I urge you to comment on that proposal once the draft is created.</p>
