<p>All statements that define as public, but the coding standard assumes that it's protected.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>While this is a seemingly trivial issue to fix, it has the potential to cause issues in the wild that simply out-weigh the need for the fix.  In short, it is possible for consumers of Zend_Db_Statement to override the parent functionality of execute() and never need to call a _execute() method.  Adding this patch would cause issues for people who have based their products around Zend_Db, and that may have extended Zend_Db_Statement, and overridden execute().</p>

<p>While this is a good patch in theory, there are BC issues at play.</p>

<p>Since there will be an architectural overhaul at 2.0 time, this will be resolve thn in that code base.  Please keep an eye on Zend/DB 2.0 development.</p>

<p>Thanks for your report and patch.
