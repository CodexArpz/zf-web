    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>In my old project with ZF1.0.3 I use camelCased actions 
e.g. for articleCalendarArchiveAction() articlecalendararchive.phtml view script is used.</p>

<p>But this doesn't work in the current trunk - r8209. A default infection in a viewRender causes that I need  article-calendar-archive.phtml. I think it is BC break and it needs to improve documentation at least.</p>

            <p>This has been raised several times. In each case, the developer was relying on undocumented behaviour. The documented behaviour is that view scripts resolved by the ViewRenderer separate camelCased words with dashes and lowercases the string (i.e., camelCased becomes camel-cased).</p>

<p>The undocumented fact, however, is that due to PHP's case insensitive resolution of function names, you could refer to actions in urls using camelCasing, and still have the intended action executed. The view renderer would see the action as camelcased, and try and resolve that view script instead.</p>

<p>As of r8235, I have modified Zend_Controller_Action::dispatch() to force case sensitivity when resolving the action. Additionally, I have documented this, and several ways to get the old, undocumented, behavior in the Migration chapter of the Zend_Controller manual.</p>

            <p>Thank you for nice description in the Migration chapter of the Zend_Controller manual, very useful.</p>
