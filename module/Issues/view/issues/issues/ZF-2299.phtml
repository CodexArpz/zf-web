    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>With the current unreleased Zend_View_Helper_Placeholder_Container_Abstract, it is possible to set and append data, but not prepend. I first realized this problem when I wanted to prepend a string with the HeadTitle view helper.</p>

            <p>This method would do the trick, but I'm sure something more space-efficient could be done:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>
public function prepend($value) {
    $values = $this-&gt;getArrayCopy();

    array_unshift($values, $value);

    $this-&gt;exchangeArray($values);
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Just noticed that this was added to SVN, but I didn't see a new PREPEND class constant to go along with SET and APPEND. Also, certain placeholder sub-classes (HeadTitle) should support this option.</p>

            <p>PREPEND constant added, and support for PREPEND in capturing provided. HeadTitle() and other helpers will be utilizing these containers, so the last comment is basically a non-issue.</p>

        <div class="body">
            <p>In Zend_View_Helper_HeadTitle::headTitle() in the incubator, on lines 69-73, the view helper restricts support to SET and APPEND. I don't see how it's a "non issue", unless when you said, "will be utilizing...", you were speaking of future changes that remove this restriction.</p>

            <p>The HeadTitle helper in the incubator is under active development; please wait to re-open the issue until an announcement has been made on-list regarding its completion. (I'm currently refactoring it yet again as I write this.)</p>

<p>incubator == active development. Please post potential issues on the relevant list prior to posting issues on incubator components, as the API may change at any time.</p>

            <p>I wasn't really sure where to post problems about incubator code, but now I know. Sorry for being a pill. :)</p>
