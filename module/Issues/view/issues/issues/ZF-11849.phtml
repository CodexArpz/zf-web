    <h3>Description</h3>

    <div class="body">
        <p>Zend_Validate does not allow for spaces in UK post codes eg:</p>

<p>AA99 9AA</p>

<p>Unicode cldr allows for the space since version 1.9</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code>

<p>ZF should be updated with the lasted version of unicode cldr.</p>

<p>This has been an annoying bug and has wasted several hours of debugging, just because a space is missing in the regex, which could of been fix ages ago by ZF.</p>

<p>Please can we have this updated now please. The offending file is Locale/Data/postalCodeData.xml</p>

            <p>We will not change CLDR content due to legal issues for ZF when delivering such a changed version.</p>

<p>ZF2 is already using the latest CLDR release.
Therefor closing this issue as fixed for next major release.</p>

            <p>So aren't you allowed to just pop in the latest postalCodeData.xml from CLDR. I wasn't suggesting changing the content but updating the CLDR to the lastest release. Instead we have to wait for a major release. I don't think this is very good if this is the case.</p>

            <p>You don't need to comment twice the same.</p>

<p>Related to "popping". No, it is not a simple update of CLDR as from CLDR 1.8.1 to 1.9 several things have changed. The class must be reworked when a minor release change of CLDR is done. And we will not mix CLDR 1.8 with CLDR 1.9 as this could also lead to other problems.</p>
