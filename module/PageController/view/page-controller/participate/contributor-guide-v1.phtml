<p>
    Zend Framework version 1 is currently supported in maintenance mode where bug fixes are accepted
    until End Of Life is announced. Version 1.12 is the last version in the 1.x series.
    If it is a new feature you wish to contribute, the best place to take this is ZF2.
</p>

<p>
    For ZF1, we are accepting bug fixes to existing components.  Security fixes will
    be provided on the 1.12 branch until EOL.  If you have a fix for
    a ZF1 issue, please carefully read
    <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/wiki/Contributing-to-Zend-Framework-1">this document.</a>
    It explains the procedures as it relates to the ZF1 process, including the requirement to sign and send
    in the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
</p>

<p class="panel">
    Note: while ZF2 is CLA free, ZF1 and its contribution process still require this.
    The license has not changed, and like ZF2 is the New BSD license.
</p>
