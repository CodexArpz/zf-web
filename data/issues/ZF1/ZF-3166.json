See Brandon's proposed method of making view helpers available to PHPTAL:\n\n    http:\/\/blog.realmofzod.com\/?p=9\n\nThe relevant line is 19, {{$this->this = $this;}}.  This allows the view code {{<tal:block tal:content=\"structure this\/layout\/content\"\/>}} to access the layout view helper.  This doesn't really seem ideal, though.  My thought was to have a Zend_View_HelperBroker object to encapsulate all the helper interaction, and be able to assign that instead of {{$this}}.\n\nBut now that I think about it, it seems like it would make more sense to have a Zend_View_Context object which only has access to view helpers and any variables assigned to it.  That way all of the private properties in Zend_View_Abstract could be protected.  In other words, all the helper methods would move to Zend_View_Context and {{assign()}} would assign variables to a Zend_View_Context object.",

This worked fine in 5.1.x, but then in 5.2.0, the PHP team made __get() no longer return arrays by reference, which made the above not work. In addition, ArrayObject was broken in 5.2.0 and, iirc, 5.2.1, such that using __get to proxy to an ArrayObject in that fashion did not work either. Right now, we actually set variables as public members, which makes everything work fine on all versions -- but using a Context object would necessitate using __get() again.\n\nA helper broker does seem like a good target, however, and with the changes to Zend_View_Abstract currently in the incubator, would be trivial to implement. The one thing I worry about, however, is that this would introduce a BC break. If so, we'd need to schedule it for 2.0.0.\n\nCan one of you come up with a prototype based on current incubator Zend_View code so we can evaluate what breaks there may be?",

                    "body": "Whew.  I slapped this together in about an hour and a half tonight based on a checkout I did a couple days ago (9348).  There are quite a few changes here, but I did my best to not break backwards compatibility, to the point of leaving in a lot of proxy methods in Zend_View which, if you use these ideas, you'll most likely want to pare down or at least deprecate.  I removed a grand total of one method from Zend_View that I'm pretty sure was for testing (having to do with helperLoadedDir, etc.) because I only had about two hours to spare for this, but I'm pretty sure you can easily figure out how to put it back in.\n\nOK, here's the executive summary:\n\n- I created a Zend_View_Context object which acts as the variable store and provides access to view helpers\n- I created Zend_View_HelperBroker based on both Zend_View and Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker.  This is necessary to remove any Zend_View reference in the context object.  There are no static methods or properties in Zend_View_HelperBroker, though.\n- Scripts can no longer call render() directly, of course, since that requires a reference to Zend_View.  There's a better alternative that people should switch to instead: Zend_View_Helper_Partial.\n- Zend_View::_run() became Zend_View_Context::run().  Not sure about the implications of this in terms of userland extensibility, but it was necessary in order to render the script within the scope of Zend_View_Context.\n- Changed all private methods in Zend_View_Abstract to protected, then moved everything from Zend_View_Abstract into Zend_View and deleted Abstract altogether as it no longer served any purpose.  Any type checking in userland view adapters should be based on Zend_View_Interface anyway.\n\nSo the gain here is that Zend_View is now completely extensible (no more wholesale copying and pasting in derivative classes) and view scripts have no way to access anything besides what they're supposed to have access to: variables and helpers.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps give you an idea of where I was coming from.  Let me know what you think.",
