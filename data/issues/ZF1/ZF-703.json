Now we added the last committer, the things from before 0.15 are not related anymore. So foreign people can see who created a file. It is not clear that the last committer was not the author of the class...\n\nRelated to the \"who commited which reason\"... we have jira where to each SVN also the reason is added. So having the SVN version added would be enough in my opinion.\n\nIf we have the main authors of a class listed we could also leave the last bug hunter in the file.\n\nProbable solutions are:\n* Having the authors (normally there will be no more than 2 or 3 I think) added to the class header and let the committer as it is\n* Having only a link to the wiki erasing the last committer - problem: not all classes have an own page\/proposal in the wiki",

The idea of the $Id$ tag is that when you are working with something like Jira, or even another developer for that matter, you can look in the file to determine which revision it is that you are talking about, and once a bug is resolved \/ a patch is entered, you can have a milestone (in terms of a revision number) when that solution was introduced.\n\nIn any case, I would be against removing the $Id$ tag in the subversion, since technically, you are considered 'bleeding edge' when you decide to use it in production code.  I would be encouraging people to be using the stable releases after version 1.0 hits.\n\nThat being said, I think the release procedure should include a global search an replace on the tagged subversion export to remove $Id$ and replace with the stable release number.  I think that is the best approach. And while it is an internal procedure, should be noted in the coding standards.\n\nAs for tracking down who is suppose to be fixing what, Jira should take care of that when bugs are filed against a specific component.\n\nthoughts?",
