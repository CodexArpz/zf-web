I can't speak for the Ldap specific use case, but in this particular case, attempting to scrub an exception stack from a method call that clearly failed has the potential to create a situation that would leave a developer with fewer facts to rectify the situation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if someone mistyped the password in a configuration file, but kept getting exceptions thrown in their development environment (about not being able to connect), it is clearly helpful to have the exact unadulterated stack trace in order to rectify the problem.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a developer should never be displaying exception messages to the screen during production (this is synonymous with display_errors = On.  In ZF1 applications, displaying exception messages is turned off during production, and turned on during development.  This should suffice for never having the password on the screen in a production environment.",

                    "body": "Mike -- you're attributing the issue to ZF, when in fact it's an exception being thrown by PDO. This is not a ZF issue at heart -- it's an issue with how PHP provides stack traces. As Ralph notes, the information in the stack trace is often useful for debugging; if the framework \"scrubs\" the stack trace, the end-user potentially misses vital information that can help them identify the cause of an issue. Additionally, once we start on a path of scrubbing, we hit a slippery slope: should we scrub usernames, too? what about database names? or paths? Basically, the concept of \"privileged\" information will vary widely between projects and organizations, and having the framework make a carte-blanche decision on this will ultimately lead to further issues.\r\n\r\nAlso, as Ralph noted, there are other ways to address this. As an example, instead of displaying errors to the user in testing, use logging, instead -- write errors and exception messages to a log (hint: Zend_Log has built in facilities for this), and then monitor the log; this can be done for exceptions as well. If you need to scrub artifacts, either for display purposes or when logging, write this logic -- it can be in your error.phtml if rendering stack traces to the screen, or as a custom Zend_Log_Filter and\/or Zend_Log_Formatter.\r\n\r\nThe point is this: only _you_ can adequately identify your application's security needs, and, as such, the onus is on _you_ to write code that will address those needs. The framework can help facilitate this (and we do, via our ErrorController and the logging component), but we cannot make blanket decisions that will affect all users -- at least not without getting consensus on such decisions.",

So as I'm sure you can understand, any time a password shows up in the clear its a red flag. But you are right, it is an issue with how PHP handles exceptions, and not a ZF problem. I (foolishly) did not realize the PDO is not something maintained by ZF.\r\n\r\nI understand how you do not want to be obfuscating information that other users would find useful.\r\n\r\nMy own solution is to surround all LDAP authentication with a try-catch and bury the exception. This is acceptable to me.",
