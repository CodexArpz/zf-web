If it were a class that is only called internally by the component it would have less impact, but this is the top-level class of the component and we need to start being careful about backward-compatibility.\n\nWe do not have a policy that class names must be nouns.  It's not a bad guideline, but I don't think we need it to be a policy.",

It promotes cohesiveness over the whole framework, and seems to have support from at least some others in the community.  A naming policy is also important for the same reasons that specifying parameter formats (e.g., camelCase), method names (verb or verb+noun), and parameter orders for similar classes.  It increases predictability and lowers the learning curve.\n\nOut of the entire framework, two (maybe three, counting Measure) top-level classes are exceptions out of almost 40 when there's no real reason for it.  The rest of the classes fall into two basic categories:\n\n* Concrete nouns (Controller, Filter, etc.)\n* Generalized nouns, divided into broad topics (Locale, Session, etc.) and specific protocols, formats, and standards (Http, Mime, etc.)\n\nObviously, I'm a bit more passionate about naming consistency and API clarity than many others, but I think since this affects the user community why not go to them and determine whether they believe a simple naming policy is important, erring on the side of no change?",

We will never again have an opportunity where the community will know full well that the api is under development and can change.\n\nI also notice that Darby's commit to Zend_Filter yesterday removed some of the depreciated validator type functions, which is why we should also revisit this.  I am just as passionate about naming as Matt is (See above) and I truly thing we should strive for consistency right now.  Calling this class Validator puts forth the most intuitive name for developers to use, and as I said, now is the BEST time to change it if we can.\n\nPlease please reconsider..

It's far better when you are able to code on instincts instead of relying on documentation.\n\nAnd I would go even further and change \"isValid\" method to \"validate\". Even if just to hint it's an action that requires some more work and is not a mere status comparison. Not to mention consistency to DOM, Java or any other php methods:\n\nhttp:\/\/pl2.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.dom-domdocument-validate.php\n\nIf that's not too much to ask, of course.",

But I and others having this opinion were overruled, and Validate was the chosen name for this component. (Originally I had chosen the name Valid, since it's shorter :))\n\nIf there were other backward-incompatible API changes pending on the component, we would have an opportunity to change the name along with making the other API changes. But as it stands currently, we would just be changing the name for the sake of changing the name, and the cost is not worth the value at this late hour, when we are wrapping up incomplete items for 0.9.0.\n\nI'm sorry to disappoint, but please don't shoot the messenger, and understand that I, too, am of the opinion that the Validator name makes more sense.",

Was it strictly an internal vote that was taken?  I ask because I've actually taken the time to dig through mailing list archives and proposal comments, and here is what I've come up with:\n\n# Art Hundiak first mentioned a revised validator.  He called it Zend_Validate.  (He would later use Zend_Validator instead.)\n# A couple months later, in the Zend_FilterChain proposal, Willie Alberty referred to it once as Zend_Validate in passing.\n# Every person who referred to the concept since the initial proposal and afterward, in his thread and elsewhere&mdash;and I mean every single person without exception&mdash;called it Zend_Validator.\n# You proposed Zend_Valid.\n# Even after this proposal, most referred to it as Zend_Validator in the comments on the proposal page and in the mailing list.  Less frequently, Zend_Valid (using your initial name) was used.\n\nUnless I'm missing it (and it's possible), at no point did anyone say that they preferred the name Zend_Validate.  Instead, overwhelmingly, Zend_Validator was used again and again.  Clearly, the community prefers the name Zend_Validator, or feels that it's more intuitive.\n\nThe recent discussion over the refactored Zend.php has also shown that the community cares about naming when they have a choice.  It's stated that this change would be too costly for 0.9.0, yet Bill just removed the Zend.php class entirely, requiring everyone with existing applications to do a search and replace for Zend::loadClass(), Zend::loadFile(), Zend::isReadable(), Zend::debug(), Zend::register(), Zend::registry(), Zend::isRegistered(), Zend::initRegistry(), and possibly one or two others I'm forgetting.  Why is an additional search and replace for Zend_Validate and Zend_Translate, which are not static and therefore actually occur less than the previous instances, prohibitively costly?  A class in core has already changed for 0.9.0.  Renaming these classes is a simple matter of searching and replacing.\n\nMany of these naming issues are coming up because this is the period before 0.9.0&mdash;when whatever names we have we're stuck with.  This is the best time to make these changes.  I just don't want to see Zend Framework become like PHP, with names that were chosen with little or no concern for naming.  I won't reopen the issue, but I urge you to reconsider.",

During internal discussions at Zend, Andi indicated his preference for using the name Validate over the other available choices, and there was no dissent over the decision.\n\nIt is not a fair comparison to make between this suggested change and the recent changes to Zend.php. The latter changes to Zend.php offered value beyond simple name changes. Unrelated functionality that had been lumped together in a \"catch-all\", miscellaneous class is now logically separated. This suggested change offers no value beyond a slightly improved name, which, in itself, is debatable.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying the name can never be changed. In fact, I agree that Zend_Validator would probably be a better name. But timing is everything, and it is not the right time to do this now. There is life after 0.9.0, I promise! :)",
