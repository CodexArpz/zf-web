In fact, NONE of them have been the result of official proposals, and are all the results of one or a very small group of developer discussions. Ralph was involved in one draft PRIOR to joining Zend, and never in any official capacity while at Zend.\n\nNext, && and || should be the standard for several reasons. First, they have operator precedence over assignment; this allows you to test against variable assignment when doing conditionals. Second, as noted by the OP, && and || are more predominant in other languages. Third, it's easier to search for these operators; using the english equivalents, you can't tell if results come from within comments, string text, or conditionals.\n\nAlso, preferred syntax is not a programmer decision in this particular case. Unless there is an actual programmatic need for using \"and\" or \"or\" (i.e., operator precedence dictates the decision), developers should stick with the standard.\n\nFinally, once the standard is ratified, we *will* update all ZF code to follow it -- but evaluate on a case-by-case basis.",

I just wanted to make clear this this issue is part of another task.\n\nAs you know I already created a coding standard testbed based on I think ralphs and some additions like docblock and so. But I can only finish it as soon as we have declared how our coding standard looks like.\n\nSo the first and generic task is to create a coding standard which we all conform to. Then I can finish my coding standard testbed which we can then integrate into our CI server. This is what I am aware of and what I wanted to be able to finish since several months. :-)",

You spent time on a project that never had a proposal, and the code sniffs you created do not target the *current* published standards. It is not _your_ job to create the coding standard; that is the internal team's job; if you want to help implement the code sniffs after we've made any changes, we'd be happy to have your help. However, again, the prior initiatives were yours and did not undergo any sort of formal community process (such as the proposal process) or any formal review from the internal team, and, as such, there has been no delay in updating the standards (as there was never a formal initiative to make changes).",

As you now said that the community even can not help, as it's the internal team's job to create a coding standard, all coding standard issues should be postponed or closed.\n\nI see that it will never be used, nor is it usefull for you.\nI'm sorry that I have written about 2000 useless tests over 2 months for nothing.\nI was said to incubator it, but as it's useless and as of your reply, even not allowed to exist as there is no proposal, I took the consequence and deleted it from incubator. Also to be process-conform again.\n\nFeel free to create something from the green mile without the need to use something existing.\n\nBtw: It is impossible to fill a proposal on a coding standard when there is no official coding standard. I spoke with several team members and we all decided together to use CS. As you said... non of the standards have officially be accepted.\n\nHow ever.. I will stop to reply on coding standard issues as not accepted work is useless and I have too much other things to do than spending time on useless things.\n\nSo it's all yours again :-)\nI hope, for us all, specially the community, that we will soon have a complete coding standard.\nWe all appreciate it and there are always requests for it.",

                    "body": "Thomas: What is *not* complete about the current coding standards? I've not heard a single word about this. As our standards are derived from PEAR standards, I would put forth that they are \"complete enough\" to cover most aspects of programming. Most questions\/concerns I've seen regarding the standards have more to do with individual developers having different preferences than with having any good use cases indicating a need for a different standard.\n\nThe PEAR group is currently evaluating new standards for PEAR2. Interestingly, they are not changing much of the existing coding standards, but instead adding new flexibility where there wasn't before, or adding standards to address PHP 5\/5.3 features that did not exist at the time the original standards were drafted. I think we can learn from these new standards and adopt them into our own.\n\nUsage of && versus 'and' are basic programming level decisions -- what operator precedence do you need for the current logic (&& is typically a better choice to ensure variable assignment works with your logic). Should there be a rule for logic-level decisions? Probably not.\n\nI'm sorry you have put so much time into this. I *don't* think it's entirely worthless. However, you *must* start using the proposal process. It will save you time in the future, and prevent you from working on items before there has been community review. In all liklihood, we can resurrect the code you have done, and modify it -- once there has been a formal process to change the coding standards (if indeed there is any reason to do so).\n\nOne note: the reason I said this has to be an internal decision is because these standards are and will be adopted by many organizations, and as such will need a unitfying view -- something that ultimately cannot come entirely from a community process. Community review is one thing, but when it comes down to it, *any* decisions made for a coding standard ultimately come down to choosing one path over another. *Nobody* is ever 100% happy with a standard. The final decisions for changes will need to be made by one person or put to a vote by a small group -- and in all liklihood, that will be the internal Zend team. What *choices* are voted on will be put to community review, however. If you want to see changes, start a proposal -- so we have *one* place to look, *one* place for community comments, and *one* place to review for a vote.",
