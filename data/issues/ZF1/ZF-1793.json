            "value": "Hi,\n\nI have just begun to use Zend_Auth.  For now, my implementation consists of descending directly from Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable.  In my class, for simplicity's sake, I simply pass the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable constructor hardcoded parameters describing the DB, columns, and treatment.\n\nLike any good developer...  ;-) ...I wrote a handful of unit tests around my simple subclass.  I pass in various combinations of the following: valid username, valid password, invalid username, invalid password.  All worked well.\n\nSo, this morning, I decided to build some tests that would add whitespace to one end, the other, or both of the valid username and password.\n\nThis test failed:\n\t\t\t$this->_auth->setIdentity($this->_username . ' '); \/\/ $this->_auth is my Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable descendant....\n\t\t\t$this->_auth->setCredential($this->_password);\n\t\t\t$result = $this->_auth->authenticate(); \/* @var $result Zend_Auth_Result *\/\n\t\t\t$this->assertNotNull($result);\n\t\t\t$this->assertEquals($result->getCode(), Zend_Auth_Result::FAILURE_IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND); \/\/ The actual result code is Zend_Auth_Result::SUCCESS...\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this is really a problem with Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable or if it's a problem with the quoteIdentifier() functionality.  But whatever the case, it seems to allow \"validUsername\" and \"validUsername \".  If the (white)space is prepended rather than appended, then it does appear to fail as expected.\n\nI can guess that there may be some debate over whether or not whitespace should be automatically trimmed off of the end of usernames.  I would be very much against that.  I would argue that the identity should match exactly what the user has typed in and submitted.  Any deviation and it's invalid.\n\nI typically don't submit bugs unless I'm quite certain I haven't missed anything.  But, I'm a little less certain in this case than I usually am simply because Zend_Auth is fairly new to me.  So, please double-check my findings.  :-)\n\nAlso, although I haven't checked this with 1.0.1, I don't remember anything in the change log that would appear to have anything to do with this.\n\nThanks,\n\nTravis\n"

However, when it comes to authentication, then I'm of the opinion that one takes precisely the input that has been supplied by the user.  Some people consider usernames and\/or passwords case-insensitive, so they will typically change the case to all upper or all lower case before inserting, updating, or comparing.  I suspect that some people would consider usernames and\/or passwords as whatever the user has entered less the white-space on either side.  Perhaps I'm alone, but that's not my approach with usernames\/passwords.  Rather, I think one should (typically) take exactly what they've typed and see if there's a match.  I would think that when one starts to filter or modify the usernames\/passwords prior to authenticating the information, then it seems like it makes the whole authentication \"barrier\" a little less secure.  (Please keep in mind that I'm not a security or authentication expert.)\n\nSo...while still on or near the fence, I think that I would prefer to see some changes to Zend_Auth to address such situations....especially if it's possible on MySQL, the DB of choice, so to speak, for a great deal of PHP developers.\n\nBut, I certainly won't be heartbroken if no one else agrees with me.  It will bug me a bit, but I think I could eventually get used to the idea of filtering or not allowing starting or trailing whitespace.  ;-)\n\nOK.  That's my two cents here.  Now I've gotta go deposit another two cents regarding the upcoming Zend_View \"concrete placeholder implementations\"....  :-)\n\nTake care...",
