Since then, it has continued for backwards compatibility purposes, but also because it adds several features ext\/json does not have (such as encoding of JavaScript literals, ability to use different charsets, and choices as to how objects are encoded\/decoded).\r\n* Zend_Http predates ext\/http. ext\/http is still not included in default PHP installs, though that may change in upcoming releases. ZF's HTTP client offers some benefits over the extension: ability to mock requests, ability to use different adapters (in fact, ext\/http would be a good additional adapter for us to utilize), etc.\r\n\r\nMy thought is that for us to include an SSH implementation, it would need to offer benefits above and beyond the PECL extension, and it would need to be functionality that a number of developers are requiring for their projects (and for which ext\/ssh2 is not an option). Regardless, the appropriate place to request new components is via a proposal in the [wiki|http:\/\/framework.zend.com\/wiki\/display\/ZFPROP\/Home].",

But I'm going off topic here.\r\n\r\nWhy would this package be beneficial? You said that Zend_Json was originally created because PHP didn't include ext\/json by default and this is certainly the case with SSH2. Zend_Ssh_Client_Adapter could also be a wrapper around ext\/ssh (ext\/ssh2) if it eventually comes out included with PHP.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the package is not properly labelled; it could be named Zend_Shell_Client and have Zend_Shell_Client_Adapter_SshAdapter and Zend_Shell_Client_Adapter_ShAdapter (or BashAdapter), etc. There could even be a Zend_Shell_Command class as a helper to build commands to be sent to the Zend_Shell_Client instance.\r\n\r\nJust a thought...",
