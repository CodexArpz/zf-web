If you run a query against all issues slated for 'next minor release', you'll see many with corresponding proposals. Getting the proposal approved is now one step in resolving the issue and getting the code released. JIRA has many advanced project management features with useful reports which can be easily surfaced in our wiki, so this seems to be a reasonable approach to lightweight project management. Let me know if there are any other questions I can clear up for you.\n\nThanks.\n,Wil",

Me for the proposal and another one for this issue.\n\nIf I would not have found this by searching through recent changes I would never have known that it exists, because it is not connected to a component.\n\nAlso to mention... proposals are well thought of, and include use cases, pre-classes, API, and so on. Issues do not include this informations.\n\nIf we want to couple issues to proposals, the issues should be\n * connected to the proper component\n * attached to the committer of the proposal or the component lead or the team leader.\n * the related issues should also be somehow be connected to the originate proposal and not be standalone.\n\n\nJust my 2 cent.",

In fact, I would encourage you to break up an issue such as this that requires a proposal in to several sub-tasks, such as ZF-2117. This both registers that someone is working on it, and it allows us to use a single system for most of our workflows (in fact we could consider modeling proposal approvals in JIRA workflows in the future- maybe this is the kind of issue-proposal connection you have in mind. This will require some effort to set up- I'll take a look at it again with you after 1.5.). The only thing I ask is that you are really committed to driving this feature to release if you mark it as yours by assigning it and putting it 'in progress'. You seem pretty determined to take this one on, Thomas, so there shouldn't be any problem there. :)\nI'll see if we can schedule a team review for your proposal next week so we can get this show on the road. As always, thanks much for all the contributions!\n\n,Wil\n",

This is why I tend to make I18N my own. And I have also seen in the past that most people can only code and do not make the rest... I do not need anyone that codes and forgets about unit tests and documentation. I've made two exception... one with Zend_Timesync where Andries made 70% of the code and usecases but no docu, and another with Shreef who did only code a little bit, and I had to rewrite the complete API to fit.\n\nBut I think we should not talk about this here, because it has nothing to do with YAML translation files :-)\n\nAll things I attach to me are I18N issues... several patches from people in the past had to be rewritten before being committed. For example the date classes... this are about 4000 lines of code (2500 of api documentation) and it's pretty complex. You have to know about datemaths and Zend_Date especially before doing any changes.\n\nWhen you look at fisheye you will see that I am one who commits pretty much. All my issues are closed pretty fast, when I am getting response. And all my accepted proposals are done.\n\nBtw: Zend_TimeSync in ready since 2 weeks for core-inclusion and waits just for agreement of the dev-team to do so... or should I just integrate it ?\nAll other proposals have not been accepted and therefor no code exists until now.\n\nRelated to proposals and issues...\nIt's good if they are coupled because I think people are more working with jira than with the proposals page.\nBut the proposals have one big benefit I won't miss... they are a sort of documentation and are well thought of.\nThe issue tracker is more a sort of project management, to collect what to do, the progress and so on.\n\nIn the past weeks I saw that the unassigned issues are raising... I thought that issues have to be connected to the components lead. If there is any patch it should be attached to the issue, reviewed by him and then be committed. Are there so much components which do not belong to a lead ?",
