As for relying on legacy PHP4 packages, while it's unfortunate, it's not a deal-breaker for us so long as the package does the work as advertised.\r\n\r\nRegarding the issues you indicate, I see no issue reports in the PEAR bug tracker detailing anything like what you're reporting; there are several patches for manually specifying files and\/or directories to exclude, but no issues indicating that this is happening arbitrarily and in an unwanted fashion.\r\n\r\nAs such, I see no reason currently not to ship the filter. If issues do occur, we can push them upstream and either put pressure on the Archive_Tar developers to correct them or assist them in the process.",

Zend_Config, on the other hand, is a standard, default component used by a large number of developers; making a requirement for functionality that may not be present in their PHP installation would make ZF unusable for them. (That said, it's possible we need to reconsider XMLReader support for Zend_Config_Xml, as I've communicated to you privately; it just wasn't slated for the 1.10 timeframe due to the number of other balls I've been juggling the last few weeks.)\r\n\r\nIf Archive_Tar does prove to be buggy, and the upstream developers are unwilling to work on fixes, we can consider then whether or not we should include a tar de\/compression library in ZF; until then, let's see how it works.",
