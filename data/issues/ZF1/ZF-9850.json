Zend_translate is set up in the beginning for all incoming requests and put in the registry so that views can later access them.  Apc is used as caching for zend_translate.  \r\n\r\nSince parameter for log is created each time, zend_translate adapter thinks the options value have changed and try to save it in the cache with the same key.  Since, there are several requests in the same second, Apc does not save the cache and throws the warning of \"Potential cache slam averted for key Zend_Translate_TMX_Options.\r\n\r\nI have tried to cache $log in the cache so that zend_translate does not think its changed but that does not work as the $writer object has stream to a file which does not work with cache.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there are no advantages of caching $options parameter as they are already in memory before they are passed within zend_translate.

I think either I am not understanding something or I am unable to explain the issue properly.\r\n\r\nI am not asking that Zend_Translate stop caching altogether.  I actually find it quite useful for caching translations themselves.  I just didn't see the point in caching the $_options attribute in Zend_Translate_Adapter abstract class.  This cached value is only accessed or set in three places.\r\n\r\n1. constructor: here if there is options already in cache, they are retrieved as used to set the member options value.  Then setOptions is called which checks to see if the array has different value than already stored. If yes, it updates the cache with the new options array.\r\n\r\n2. setoptions:\r\n\r\n3. setlocale: this updates the locale value in options and resets the cache parameter with the options.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, this cached value is not retrieved anywhere except in the constructor. If that is the case, I do not see how  options could possibly be coupled with their translations. \r\n\r\nThe problem I have is since $log parameter in options is a new instance (though has the same values as before), it thinks the options array is dirty and tries to update\/save the array again which generates the notices\/warnings as there are way too many save requests for the same key.\r\n\r\nAgain, I could be missing a big part here as you obviously have a lot better understanding of this component.  However, as far as I can tell, removing the code that caches this parameter would have no effect on behavior of zend_translate as long as $options array is passed in every time zend_translate is initialized.

Good behaviour would be to check if we have a valid cache and if not to create the options and cache them. I think it is just left over code that should be removed. Commenting out the two references to a cache id with _Options in it didn't break anything as the important cache is the cache for the specific translation.",

But when Bootstrap is processed again it would, in case that there is no cache, mean that the whole tree has to be searched again. Options hold not only manually set options but also the active locale from the last call.\r\n\r\nWhen you think that caching is not necessary then do not attach a cache.\r\n\r\n@Menno:\r\nIn your case options are not load from cache. There is only ONE place where options are load from cache and this is at contruction. In your case the cache did not exist before initiation. When you call it twice then the second call would load from cache which is correct. Not loading from cache would mean that cache is useless.\r\n\r\nEven if you did not read the code correct, the cache is ONLY written when there are changes within the data which has to be cached.\r\n\r\nAnd no: Also the options cache is necessary. Only because you think that you don't use it within your code it does not mean that other components also don't use it.\r\n\r\nWhen I would try to save the cache 4 times within a second APC should not report problems as long as the saved data is different from the already saved ones. In your case the options change from line one to line two. Therefor the changed options are saved which makes APC report a problem.",

Every time a locale is being set, the cache is saved. However, all requests have different locales, so the options are stored every request again.\r\nWhen using the File cache backend in a high volume environment, it causes a lot of errors about being unable to chmod, unlink, etc a file, because the file is written each time again.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the reason to cache the options array?",
