I have been told that no breaking changes are allowed in the library now that the 1.0 milestone has been reached.\n\nAlso, we couldn't rename it to Zend_Service_Google, as this component isn't intended to work with all Google services -- only those that adhere to the GData protocol.  So, it would have to be Zend_Service_Gdata or Zend_Service_Google_Gdata.    Both of these names are incredibly long and would make it very difficult to construct new instances of the classes in this component.  For instance, imagine constructing a new class to represent an atom title.  It would be $title = new Zend_Service_Gdata_App_Extension_Title('text') or $title = new Zend_Service_Google_Gdata_App_Extension_Title(\"text\");  Granted, we have a magic factory method to make this shorter (Zend_Gdata::__call), but there are cases that some people wouldn't want to use it.\n\n",

Currently I feel that the GData component is located in the best place for the next release for a few reasons.\n1) Backwards compatibility- we'll be breaking it in future releases, but only with sufficient justification. BC is more important for minor releases- this might be something we could entertain for a major release, but not the next release.\n2) We have a special partnership with Google to develop these components, one of the terms of which is that we distribute a standalone GData release. This is well modeled as a 'top level' component for these purposes.\n3) GData services are different from most of the other web services we have clients for because they are feed-based. This isn't really a particularly important difference from a developer- or user-standpoint, but they are likely to have very different dependencies and may not reuse much of what we put in the Zend_Services package (not that there's much there now, but for the future).\n\nHope you understand, and keep that feedback coming.",

So I would think that Zend_Service_Gdata would be good.\n\n@Wil: The API break policy is pretty sensible, but what about renaming it in 1.2.0 or something like that? If I understood you correctly, breaking the API in 1.2.0 would be ok, wouldn't it? The special Google contract could be resolved by adjusting the class names when rolling out a Zend_Gdata release. With a little bit of sed-magic this should not be hard (I would be willing to contribute the required build script, if you want).",
