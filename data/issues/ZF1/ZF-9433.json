They still issue such card numbers for testing and integration purposes which caused problems as we pre-validate things prior to handing over to the payment gateway.\r\n\r\nThe quote you posted is interesting in it's phrasing: It still says \"up to 16 digits\" in both the \"until 2011\" and the \"new\" sections which concerns me slightly. They should really use the term \"exactly 16 digits\" if that's what they mean....\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do about this. While I agree the number is technically invalid, if this trips a lot of people up during their testing phase it can cause a lot of problems.\r\n\r\nI can see my original concern of loosing money from customers is invalid, but loosing development time is still a concern. Obviously this may not be a problem in a wider sense but if gateways other than SagePay still regularly use such numbers would it be wise to still accept them until usage has dropped to a suitably low level? I have no idea how we'd go about gauging how many gateways still use them, it could be a very isolated case or it could be quite common. Any thoughts?",

My only real concern now is that this ultimately causes other developers a lot of head scratching if this kind of \"valid 13 digit test card\" practice is common place among gateway providers.

I guess we just need to keep on top of our testing practices with third parties so that they do not used the card.\r\n\r\nThanks for your effort and replies and I'll put this one down to being SagePay's fault and hopefully an isolated practice rather and a widespread misuse from other gateways too.",
